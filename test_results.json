        "title": "ENSURING A NATIONAL POLICY FRAMEWORK FOR ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE",
        "summary": "This executive order outlines the United States' commitment to establishing a national policy framework for artificial intelligence to enhance its global dominance while addressing excessive state regulations that hinder innovation.",
        "full_text": "By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered:\n\nSection 1. Purpose. United States leadership in Artificial Intelligence (AI) will promote United States national and economic security and dominance across many domains. Pursuant to Executive Order 14179 of January 23, 2025 (Removing Barriers to American Leadership in Artificial Intelligence), I revoked my predecessor\u2019s attempt to paralyze this industry and directed my Administration to remove barriers to United States AI leadership. My Administration has already done tremendous work to advance that objective, including by updating existing Federal regulatory frameworks to remove barriers to and encourage adoption of AI applications across sectors. These efforts have already delivered tremendous benefits to the American people and led to trillions of dollars of investments across the country. But we remain in the earliest days of this technological revolution and are in a race with adversaries for supremacy within it.\n\nTo win, United States AI companies must be free to innovate without cumbersome regulation. But excessive State regulation thwarts this imperative. First, State-by-State regulation by definition creates a patchwork of 50 different regulatory regimes that makes compliance more challenging, particularly for start-ups. Second, State laws are increasingly responsible for requiring entities to embed ideological bias within models. For example, a new Colorado law banning \u201calgorithmic discrimination\u201d may even force AI models to produce false results in order to avoid a \u201cdifferential treatment or impact\u201d on protected groups. Third, State laws sometimes impermissibly regulate beyond State borders, impinging on interstate commerce.\n\nMy Administration must act with the Congress to ensure that there is a minimally burdensome national standard \u2014 not 50 discordant State ones. The resulting framework must forbid State laws that conflict with the policy set forth in this order. That framework should also ensure that children are protected, censorship is prevented, copyrights are respected, and communities are safeguarded. A carefully crafted national framework can ensure that the United States wins the AI race, as we must.\n\nUntil such a national standard exists, however, it is imperative that my Administration takes action to check the most onerous and excessive laws emerging from the States that threaten to stymie innovation.\n\nSec. 2. Policy. It is the policy of the United States to sustain and enhance the United States\u2019 global AI dominance through a minimally burdensome national policy framework for AI.\n\nSec. 3. AI Litigation Task Force. Within 30 days of the date of this order, the Attorney General shall establish an AI Litigation Task Force (Task Force) whose sole responsibility shall be to challenge State AI laws inconsistent with the policy set forth in section 2 of this order, including on grounds that such laws unconstitutionally regulate interstate commerce, are preempted by existing Federal regulations, or are otherwise unlawful in the Attorney General\u2019s judgment, including, if appropriate, those laws identified pursuant to section 4 of this order. The Task Force shall consult from time to time with the Special Advisor for AI and Crypto, the Assistant to the President for Science and Technology, the Assistant to the President for Economic Policy, and the Assistant to the President and Counsel to the President regarding the emergence of specific State AI laws that warrant challenge.\n\nSec. 4. Evaluation of State AI Laws. Within 90 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of Commerce, consistent with the Secretary\u2019s authorities under 47 U.S.C. 902(b), shall, in consultation with the Special Advisor for AI and Crypto, the Assistant to the President for Economic Policy, the Assistant to the President for Science and Technology, and the Assistant to the President and Counsel to the President, publish an evaluation of existing State AI laws that identifies onerous laws that conflict with the policy set forth in section 2 of this order, as well as laws that should be referred to the Task Force established pursuant to section 3 of this order. That evaluation of State AI laws shall, at a minimum, identify laws that require AI models to alter their truthful outputs, or that may compel AI developers or deployers to disclose or report information in a manner that would violate the First Amendment or any other provision of the Constitution. The evaluation may additionally identify State laws that promote AI innovation consistent with the policy set forth in section 2 of this order.\n\nSec. 5. Restrictions on State Funding. (a) Within 90 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of Commerce, through the Assistant Secretary of Commerce for Communications and Information, shall issue a Policy Notice specifying the conditions under which States may be eligible for remaining funding under the Broadband Equity Access and Deployment (BEAD) Program that was saved through my Administration\u2019s \u201cBenefit of the Bargain\u201d reforms, consistent with 47 U.S.C. 1702(e)-(f). That Policy Notice must provide that States with onerous AI laws identified pursuant to section 4 of this order are ineligible for non-deployment funds, to the maximum extent allowed by Federal law. The Policy Notice must also describe how a fragmented State regulatory landscape for AI threatens to undermine BEAD-funded deployments, the growth of AI applications reliant on high-speed networks, and BEAD\u2019s mission of delivering universal, high-speed connectivity.\n\n(b) Executive departments and agencies (agencies) shall assess their discretionary grant programs in consultation with the Special Advisor for AI and Crypto and determine whether agencies may condition such grants on States either not enacting an AI law that conflicts with the policy of this order, including any AI law identified pursuant to section 4 or challenged pursuant to section 3 of this order, or, for those States that have enacted such laws, on those States entering into a binding agreement with the relevant agency not to enforce any such laws during the performance period in which it receives the discretionary funding.\n\nSec. 6. Federal Reporting and Disclosure Standard. Within 90 days of the publication of the identification specified in section 4 of this order, the Chairman of the Federal Communications Commission shall, in consultation with the Special Advisor for AI and Crypto, initiate a proceeding to determine whether to adopt a Federal reporting and disclosure standard for AI models that preempts conflicting State laws.\n\nSec. 7. Preemption of State Laws Mandating Deceptive Conduct in AI Models. Within 90 days of the date of this order, the Chairman of the Federal Trade Commission shall, in consultation with the Special Advisor for AI and Crypto, issue a policy statement on the application of the Federal Trade Commission Act\u2019s prohibition on unfair and deceptive acts or practices under 15 U.S.C. 45 to AI models. That policy statement must explain the circumstances under which State laws that require alterations to the truthful outputs of AI models are preempted by the Federal Trade Commission Act\u2019s prohibition on engaging in deceptive acts or practices affecting commerce.\n\nSec. 8. Legislation. (a) The Special Advisor for AI and Crypto and the Assistant to the President for Science and Technology shall jointly prepare a legislative recommendation establishing a uniform Federal policy framework for AI that preempts State AI laws that conflict with the policy set forth in this order.\n\n(b) The legislative recommendation called for in subsection (a) of this section shall not propose preempting otherwise lawful State AI laws relating to:\n\n(i) child safety protections;\n\n(ii) AI compute and data center infrastructure, other than generally applicable permitting reforms;\n\n(iii) State government procurement and use of AI; and\n\n(iv) other topics as shall be determined.\n\nSec. 9. General Provisions. (a) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:\n\n(i) the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or\n\n(ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.\n\n(b) This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.\n\n(c) This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.\n\n(d) The costs for publication of this order shall be borne by the Department of Commerce.\n\nDONALD J. TRUMP\n\nTHE WHITE HOUSE,\n\nDecember 11, 2025.",

        "summary": "This article explores the potential economic impacts of artificial intelligence, discussing predictions ranging from modest GDP increases to significant job automation. It emphasizes the need for both data-driven analysis and imaginative approaches to understand AI's broader effects.",
        "full_text": "AI is transforming the economy \u2014 understanding its impact requires both data and imagination\n\nHow will artificial intelligence reshape the global economy? Some economists predict only a small boost \u2014 around a 0.9% increase in gross domestic product over the next ten years. Others foresee a revolution that might add between US$17 trillion and $26 trillion to annual global economic output and automate up to half of today\u2019s jobs by 2045. But even before the full impacts materialize, beliefs about our AI future affect the economy today \u2014 steering young people\u2019s career choices, guiding government policy and driving vast investment flows into semiconductors and other components of data centres.\n\nGiven the high stakes, many researchers and policymakers are increasingly attempting to precisely quantify the causal impact of AI through natural experiments and randomized controlled trials. In such studies, one group gains access to an AI tool while another continues under normal conditions; other factors are held fixed. Researchers can then analyse outcomes such as productivity, satisfaction and learning.\n\nYet, when applied to AI, this type of evidence faces two challenges. First, by the time they are published, causal estimates of AI\u2019s effects can be outdated. For instance, one study found that call-centre workers handled queries 15% faster when using 2020 AI tools. Another showed that software developers with access to coding assistants in 2022\u201323 completed 26% more tasks than did those without such tools. But AI capabilities are advancing at an astounding pace. For example, since ChatGPT\u2019s release in 2022, AI tools can now correctly handle three times as many simulated customer-support chats on their own as they could before. The better, cheaper AI of tomorrow will produce different economic effects.\n\nSecond, carefully controlled studies do not capture the wider ripple effects that accompany AI adoption. For example, the studies involving call-centre workers and software developers found that when organizational structure remained fixed, the less-experienced workers benefited most from AI assistance. But in the real world, managers might respond by reorganizing work or even replacing some of the less-experienced workers with AI systems. If they do, the effect on those individuals could be the opposite of that estimated in controlled studies. Indeed, payroll data suggest that employment of younger workers has declined since 2022, particularly in occupations that include tasks that AI excels at, such as customer service and software development. However, researchers are still trying to understand how much of the pattern is attributable to AI technology.\n\nCarefully controlled studies are like flashing a bright, narrow spotlight: they are only part of the illumination needed to understand how society is adapting to AI. With so much still unknown about its broader economic and social effects, popular debate often slips into speculative, science-fiction narratives of a world dominated by machine intelligence.\n\nSocial science could help to navigate these uncertainties, but it would require both imagination and grounding. Here, I describe three complementary approaches that can guide researchers working in this rapidly evolving field.\n\nOne approach is to create what economist Jean Tirole calls social science fiction \u2014 speculation about the future that remains rooted in fundamental economic principles and behavioural theories. Rather than relying on imagination alone, this kind of analysis uses models to explore how technologies might interact with market forces.\n\nFor example, in 2019, researchers modelled how self-driving cars might reshape cities and found that the vehicles could make traffic worse. Because passengers in self-driving cars can relax, read or watch videos, the personal cost of time spent in traffic falls. But as more people choose to travel by car, they impose greater congestion on others. Whether that leads to inefficiency will depend on whether governments implement policies such as congestion pricing to correct the \u2018externality\u2019.\n\nAnother illustration of imaginative, yet grounded, social science comes from research on how market forces might limit AI\u2019s disruptive potential. Studies suggest that, as automation boosts productivity in some tasks, other activities that cannot easily be automated \u2014 such as creative direction or vetting final outputs \u2014 will grow in relative value. That might raise demand for labour, and therefore wages, in such jobs. These opportunities could cushion some of the disruptive effects of automation. But it might also deepen inequalities between people who thrive in these roles and those who do not.\n\nMore thought experiments like these can help policymakers to imagine how the economy might shift in a more disciplined manner. Such experiments can identify which indicators to monitor and provide a head start on planning the policies that might be needed. Other open problems include understanding the incentives to create knowledge for AI systems, and how innovation and economic growth might be affected if AI labs remain competitive with each other, or if one pulls ahead as a clear market leader.\n\nAs well as theory, policymakers will also need evidence to understand how the economy will change. Different types of information need to combine to form a more complete picture.\n\nOne common approach to assessing AI capabilities is benchmarking \u2014 testing the systems on standardized tasks, much as exams do. Benchmarks can assess an AI system\u2019s ability to solve mathematics problems, respond to customer-support requests or diagnose medical conditions. However, benchmark scores often diverge from performance in real-world settings, where tasks are noisier, more complex and context-dependent. For example, a medical AI system might perform well on textbook-style clinical questions, but could misinterpret communications from patients if they omit key details. More research is needed to design benchmarks that better capture real-world performance.\n\nIf AI is anywhere near as transformative as many expect, its effects will show up in numerous indicators that can be monitored in real time, such as tracking which tasks people use AI for. These usage data show, for instance, that AI chatbots are often used for software development, suggesting that this sector might feel the earliest effects of AI adoption. Other indicators include employment, job openings and whether firms that integrate AI earn higher profits and expand. However, there will be questions that such descriptive indicators alone cannot answer. For that reason, researchers might still attempt to measure the causal impact of AI: that is, whether AI causes improvements, rather than merely being adopted by high performers who also happen to be more willing to try new technologies.\n\nEstimating AI\u2019s causal effects is difficult because the technology is evolving and organizations are adapting. But this challenge is not unique to AI. Similar issues arise when evaluating how any pilot programme \u2014 whether in business, education or public health \u2014 will perform once it is expanded. When scaled up, programmes often encounter fresh constraints or trigger wider economic fallouts. Economists have developed methods to anticipate these scaling effects when designing experiments, such as replicating the conditions of the eventual implementer \u2014 for example, a government agency \u2014 rather than those of the more agile, well-resourced organizations that typically run pilots. Researchers studying AI can similarly attempt to anticipate future changes when designing experiments.\n\nOne important parameter is the cost of running AI models, which has been falling. Researchers can model how cost declines might affect the viability of different applications. For example, one study examined AI usage by teachers in Sierra Leone who pay for Internet access by the megabyte. In early 2022, querying an AI chatbot was 12 times more expensive than loading a standard web page; by 2025, thanks to falling compute costs and the bandwidth efficiency of AI, using the technology had become 98% cheaper than accessing a web page. This cost advantage suggests that AI might expand access to information in low-resource settings where the Internet is expensive.\n\nThe capabilities of AI are another crucial determinant of its impact. It is hard to predict how these will evolve, but researchers can try to anticipate how humans might respond to more-powerful systems. Even as technology advances, human behaviour tends to follow stable patterns \u2014 in terms of how people develop trust, how they respond to incentives and how they adapt to automation.",

        "summary": "The second week of December 2025 marked a significant shift in artificial intelligence, highlighting its maturation through regulation, security concerns, and deeper reasoning models. This article discusses key developments in AI during this period.",
        "full_text": "The second week of December made one thing clear: artificial intelligence is no longer just about new features and flashy demos. AI is entering a more mature phase \u2014 one defined by regulation, security concerns, legal pressure, and deeper reasoning models.\n\nHere\u2019s what actually happened \u2014 and why it matters.\n\n**AI Agents Meet Corporate Reality**\n\nThe week began with a signal that enterprise AI is growing up.\n\nA new security-focused tool was introduced to help companies audit **AI agent permissions** inside internal systems. As autonomous agents gain access to CRMs, analytics platforms, internal documents, and workflows, the question is no longer *what AI can do*, but *what it should be allowed to access*.\n\nThis reflects a broader shift in 2025: AI agents are increasingly treated as digital employees \u2014 and that comes with compliance, audits, and risk management.\n\n**Music, Video, and the One-Click Creative Stack**\n\nMidweek attention shifted back to creativity.\n\nNew AI tools gained traction that automatically generate **video visuals from music tracks** in under a minute. By analyzing tempo, mood, and genre, these systems create ready-to-publish content for Shorts, Reels, and TikTok.\n\nAt the same time, **Mozart AI** launched *Vibe Sessions*, a chat-based approach to music creation. Users can brainstorm ideas, remix tracks, and generate demos through conversation. Video features are still in beta, but the direction is clear: music, visuals, and storytelling are converging into a single AI-driven workflow.\n\n**New Models for Developers and Creators**\n\nDecember 10 brought notable updates for both engineers and audio creators.\n\nA new coding-focused language model, **Devstral 2**, was released with improved handling of large codebases. Importantly, a smaller version supports local, on-premise deployment \u2014 a direct response to privacy and security demands from enterprises.\n\nIn audio, **ACE Studio 2.0** expanded its capabilities with over 140 synthetic voices, enhanced text-to-song generation, and voice style transfer. These tools are increasingly used beyond music production \u2014 from marketing to branded content.\n\n## Get Aimarketwave\u2019s stories in your inbox\n\nJoin Medium for free to get updates from this writer.\n\nSubscribe\n\n**From Faster Answers to Deeper Thinking**\n\nOn December 11, Google introduced **Gemini Deep Think**, a reasoning-focused mode designed for complex analytical tasks. Instead of prioritizing speed, the model runs parallel reasoning chains to improve depth and accuracy.\n\nMeanwhile, Adobe took a different approach to productivity. Photoshop, Express, and Acrobat were integrated directly into ChatGPT, signaling a move toward unified AI workspaces where text, visuals, and documents live in a single interface.\n\n**AI Avatars Face the Law**\n\nThe most consequential development of the week came from regulation.\n\nNew rules in New York now require advertisers to clearly disclose when AI-generated avatars are used in ads. The goal is transparency \u2014 and preventing audiences from being unknowingly influenced by synthetic personas.\n\nAround the same time, OpenAI quietly renamed a feature in its video generator Sora. The feature previously known as **\u201cCameo\u201d** became **\u201cCharacters\u201d** following trademark conflicts. This wasn\u2019t a branding refresh \u2014 it was a legal necessity.\n\nTogether, these events highlight a growing reality: AI products are now subject to the same intellectual property and consumer protection pressures as traditional software and media.\n\n**AI Becomes the Story of the Year**\n\nOn December 13, *TIME* made a symbolic statement by naming multiple AI industry leaders collectively as *Person of the Year*. The message was clear \u2014 2025 is widely seen as the year AI crossed from experimentation into mainstream infrastructure.\n\n**The Bigger Picture**\n\nBy the end of the week, industry reports confirmed another accelerating trend: **AI-generated content now makes up a dominant share of new digital material**. This shift is already reshaping SEO, media trust, and content labeling standards.\n\nThe takeaway from December 8\u201314 is simple but significant:\n\nAI is no longer just evolving technically. It\u2019s being governed, audited, renamed, restricted \u2014 and embedded deeply into real-world systems.\n\nThat\u2019s what maturity looks like.\n\n*More AI news and analysis coming soon.*",

These include applications for development projects, humanitarian operations, and responsible AI policies.\n\nA product of the UN Interagency Working Group on AI, the online hub was developed by three key agencies: the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), the International Telecommunication Union (ITU), and the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO).\n\nThe hub also furthers the system-wide aim to enhance coordination and strengthen programmatic coherence on AI efforts by helping identify shared priorities and synergies.\n\n**What you\u2019ll find there**\n\n* **A dynamic searchable database:** Explore all UN initiatives on AI by sector, region, or thematic area using a standardized taxonomy for clarity and consistency.\n* **Direct links to key portals:** Access specialized resources like UNESCO\u2019s Global AI Ethics Observatory, the ILO Observatory on AI and Work, and the G20 Technology Policy Assistance Facility.\n* **Practical insights and case studies:** Learn from real-world examples of AI in action for health, education, climate and more.\n\nHere are some examples of the materials you can find:\n\n* The World Food Programme (WFP) is using AI to tackle \u201chidden hunger\u201d by estimating and mapping risks of inadequate micronutrient intake.\n* A pilot study by the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD) combines multispectral satellite imagery with AI-driven deep learning models to monitor mining sites and enhance environmental management in South Africa and Lesotho.\n* The United Nations Children\u2019s Fund (UNICEF) is empowering people with speech and language impairments with Cboard, a digital communication tool that converts text into natural speech.\n* The World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) is improving accessibility and efficiency in international diplomacy with AI-driven speech-to-text services.\n* An ITU-led group is using AI to identify and quantify vulnerable populations lacking connectivity as part of the Early Warnings for All initiative, with pilot projects enhancing targeted early warning capabilities and intervention strategies in Fiji, Tonga, and Vanuatu.\n\n**Just the beginning**\n\nThe hub will remain a living resource, continuously updated with new projects, insights, impacts and focal points. As the next step, a generative AI-powered interface will make navigation even easier.\n\nIn the meantime, hub users will already find a wealth of international contributions, knowledge, experience, and expertise on AI as a shared good for humanity.\n\nExplore the UN AI Resource Hub and make use of its resources today.",

The Nasdaq Composite fell for a second straight day on Monday, losing 2.6% in the period, on concerns over the potential of an AI bubble and weak employment data. The U.S. is due to report labor market statistics including November's nonfarm payrolls number later Tuesday.\n\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW\n\nDon't miss another story.Subscribe to the Crypto Daybook Americas Newsletter today.

This implies a 24-hour move of 2.6%, which is nothing out of ordinary even as key economic data are due for release.\n* Exchanges liquidated over $660 million in leveraged futures bets in 24 hours. Most of these were longs, clearing bullish leverage from the market.\n* The cumulative global open interest (OI) in BTC futures crossed above 700K BTC, the highest since Nov. 21. An uptick in OI alongside a drop in spot price is said to represent an influx of bearish short positions and confirm downtrend.\n* XRP's futures OI rose to 1.96B XRP, the highest since Oct. 11.\n* The OI-adjusted cumulative volume delta for most major tokens fell, indicating aggressive net selling pressure.\n* On Deribit, BTC and ETH put options continue to trade pricier than calls, indicating persistent downside concerns. The persistent put premium also stems from institutional interest in call overwriting strategies.\n* The $85K bitcoin put has emerged as the second-most popular option behind the $100K call.\n* Block flows featured BTC put diagonal spreads, put ration spreads and straddles. In ETH's case, traders preferred put butterflies.\n\n### Token talk\n\n* The altcoin market continues to yearn for a bullish catalyst following a two-month period of corrective price action.\n* ASTER, ONDO and STRK all lost more than 10% in the past 24 hours, underperforming the wider market.\n* One glimmer of hope for the altcoin market is that several tokens are now in \"oversold\" territory, according the average crypto relative strength index (RSI) indicator.\n* This suggests that the market may be ready for a slight bounce before the U.S. employment figures are released.\n* A number of tokens including XRP, SOL and ADA are also approaching key levels of support that provided a series of local bottoms over the past year, so while altcoin sentiment is low, this could be an area that sparks investor appetite.",

        "summary": "Experts from Northeastern University discuss the recent volatility in the cryptocurrency market, particularly bitcoin, and assert that cryptocurrencies are likely to remain a significant part of the financial landscape despite fluctuations in value.",
        "full_text": "On Oct. 6, bitcoin hit an all-time high. Things haven\u2019t been going well since, with the cryptocurrency down 17% in November alone, and December starting out with a 7% drop, and then a 7% gain. What\u2019s happening on the blockchain? Northeastern University cryptocurrency experts Ravi Sarathy and Alper Koparan said many macroeconomic factors \u2014 as well as the inherent volatility of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies \u2014 are contributing to the recent wide swings in valuation. \u201cI would say that, more than not, there is an overenthusiasm for all things crypto,\u201d said Sarathy, professor of international business and strategy at Northeastern. But the experts also said bitcoin and cryptocurrencies in general are likely here to stay. \u201cCryptocurrency markets, I believe those markets will be there forever, regardless of the price of bitcoin,\u201d said Koparan, an assistant teaching professor of finance. \u201cIt\u2019s like a playground for individual investors. It\u2019s something you can do over the internet without any limitations, restrictions. That activity will continue.\u201d Alper Koparan and Ravi Sarathy of Northeastern University believe the wild fluctuations in the bitcoin market in 2025 will not doom cryptocurrency. Bitcoin hit an all-time high of around $126,000 on Oct. 6, after rising 33% in 2025. But the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency by market value has since tanked \u2014 down roughly 14% by the end of October, down 17% in November, and down another 7% on Dec. 1, although it erased that most recent loss the next day. Sarathy and Koparan both said that bitcoin \u2014 which arose from the 2008-2009 Great Recession as a decentralized, easy and fast, peer-to-peer trading network \u2014 is inherently volatile for several reasons. First, its demand exceeds the total circulating supply, and its production is limited to 21 million coins, which the cryptocurrency is rapidly approaching. Cryptocurrencies like bitcoin are also not tied to any country\u2019s currency and are readily accessible to individual investors through the blockchain \u2014 a digital ledger where transactions are recorded. Finally, cryptocurrencies have limited regulation. This can lead to frequent speculation \u2014 either buying bitcoin or a cryptocurrency and hoping to sell it for a quick profit or shorting it \u2014 or using bitcoin as leverage to buy more of a financial product. \u201cThat\u2019s really where I think the big, big volatility comes from,\u201d Sarathy said. But it\u2019s not just individual investors who are in on the game. While the Securities and Exchange Commission under President Joe Biden seemed \u201csomewhat skeptical\u201d of cryptocurrencies and blockchain-based ventures, the second Trump administration marked a \u201cfairly dramatic shift\u201d toward these ventures, Sarathy said. This encouraged institutional and corporate investors to enter the crypto market, particularly bitcoin, by investing in exchange-traded funds, or ETFs, related to crypto, Koparan said. But recently, institutional investors have reversed course, favoring safer assets such as gold and silver. \u201cWithin the last two years, we have seen significant inflow from funds or institutional investors on ETFs,\u201d Koparan said. \u201cBut the end of October and November were months with negative flows.\u201d Moreover, Koparan said global bond markets are in flux. The Bank of Japan is expected to raise interest rates that have been around 0% for over a decade, while the Federal Reserve is expected to cut interest rates in the United States, Koparan explained. This is prompting concerns of a reversal in the flow of \u201ccarry trades\u201d that have fueled growth in the United States and other popular markets, Koparan said. In a carry trade, an investor borrows in the currency of a country where interest rates are low, (for example, Japan) and uses it to invest in a currency where interest rates are higher, (for example, the United States) and then, upon the investments\u2019 maturity, converts the net amount back to the original currency. \u201cIt may be certain investors read this as a warning signal,\u201d Koparan said. \u201cAnd what you would do in such a situation is you would simply exit high-risk investments, and bitcoin is one of them.\u201d So, will the crypto market collapse as institutional investors flee bitcoin? Not necessarily. \u201cIn the history of bitcoin, there are multiple time frames that we can relate to the events of today,\u201d Koparan said. \u201cThe only difference today is that this price movement, price action is mostly due to institutional investors.\u201d The market has weathered downturns before, most notably in the November 2022 FTX collapse, Sarathy added. But he noted that the long-term trend for bitcoin should be considered. In about 15 years, bitcoin has gone from zero to $120,000, and now it\u2019s down to about $91,000, Sarathy said. \u201cBut it\u2019s still pretty amazing.\u201d",

        "full_text": "Amidst the red wave of bitcoin, ethereum (ETH) showed relative resilience.\n\nJAKARTA - The global cryptocurrency market came under renewed pressure on Sunday trading, with Bitcoin slipping below the psychological level of US$89,000 as risk appetite thinned amid low weekend liquidity.\n\nBitcoin dominance was observed to remain around 57%. Heavy selling pressure was evident in major altcoins such as Solana, XRP, Dogecoin, and Cardano (ADA), all of which recorded double\u2011digit losses over the past month.\n\nAccording to coindesk.com (14 December), amid the market downturn, Ethereum (ETH) showed relative resilience. The world\u2019s second\u2011largest cryptocurrency traded around US$3,104, posting a gain of more than 2% over the past week, effectively outperforming Bitcoin\u2019s weekly performance.\n\nOverall, the cryptocurrency market capitalisation shrank by 0.8% to US$3.15 trillion. Technical analyst Ali Martinez warned via X that Bitcoin is now in a vulnerable position, with US$86,000 seen as the last line of defence which, if breached, could trigger further selling.\n\nMarket tensions were mainly driven by anticipation of macroeconomic data. In the United States, investors awaited inflation figures and speeches from Federal Reserve Governors Stephen Miran and Christopher J. Waller.\n\nMeanwhile, in Asia, markets monitored Bank of Japan (BOJ) Governor Kazuo Ueda, where a predicted interest rate hike to 0.75% on Thursday is feared to hit global liquidity by unwinding yen\u2011funded carry trades.

        "summary": "The report discusses five key technology trends that organizations must navigate as they transition from experimentation to impactful implementation. It highlights the urgency of adapting to rapid technological advancements.",
        "full_text": "As technology innovation and adoption accelerate, five trends reveal how successful organizations are moving from experimentation to impact. I spend most of my year in conversations with technology leaders, asking what\u2019s working, what isn\u2019t, and what keeps them up at night. Lately, those conversations have taken on a different quality. The question used to be \u201cWhat can we do with AI?\u201d Now it\u2019s \u201cHow do we move from experimentation to impact?\u201d The focus has moved from endless pilots to real business value, and there\u2019s a sense of urgency behind it all. Not because the technology is getting better\u2014though it is\u2014but because the pace of change itself has accelerated. The numbers tell the story (figure 1). The telephone took 50 years to reach 50 million users. The internet took seven years. A leading generative AI tool reached about twice that many in two months. As of this writing, that tool has over 800 million weekly users\u2014roughly 10% of the planet\u2019s population. But rapid adoption is only the surface. Innovation is compounding; forces aren\u2019t simply additive, but multiplicative. Think of it as a flywheel: Better technology enables more applications. More applications generate more data. More data attracts more investment. More investment builds better infrastructure. Better infrastructure reduces costs. Lower costs enable more experimentation. Each improvement simultaneously accelerates all the others. It\u2019s why AI startups scale from US$1 million to US$30 million in revenue five times faster than SaaS companies did. It\u2019s why the knowledge half-life in AI has shrunk to months from years. And it\u2019s why one chief information officer (CIO) told me, \u201cThe time it takes us to study a new technology now exceeds that technology\u2019s relevance window.\u201d Every organization we studied is discovering the same truth: What got them here won\u2019t get them there. The infrastructure built for cloud-first strategies can\u2019t handle AI economics. Processes designed for human workers don\u2019t work for agents. Security models built for perimeter defense don\u2019t protect against threats operating at machine speed. IT operating models built for service delivery don\u2019t drive business transformation. This isn\u2019t only about enhancement. It\u2019s about rebuilding. For 17 years, Tech Trends has explored emerging technologies poised to reshape business in the next 18 to 24 months. Our research is based on trend sensing from conversations with Deloitte subject matter experts and external technology leaders, as well as Deloitte\u2019s proprietary research on emerging technologies. This year, the data reveals five interconnected forces. AI goes physical: Navigating the convergence of AI and robotics. Amazon deployed its millionth robot, and its DeepFleet AI coordinates the entire robot fleet, improving travel efficiency within warehouses by 10%. BMW\u2019s factories have cars driving themselves through kilometer-long production routes. Intelligence isn\u2019t confined to screens anymore; it\u2019s embodied, autonomous, and solving real problems in the physical world. The agentic reality check: Preparing for a silicon-based workforce. Only 11% of organizations have agents in production, despite 38% piloting them. The gap between pilot to production tells you everything. Forty-two percent are still developing their strategy, while 35% have no strategy at all. Gartner predicts that 40% of agentic projects will fail by 2027\u2014not because the technology doesn\u2019t work, but because organizations are automating broken processes instead of redesigning operations. HPE\u2019s chief financial officer captured what works: \u201cWe wanted to select an end-to-end process where we could truly transform, not just solve for a single pain point.\u201d Redesign, don\u2019t automate. That\u2019s the pattern separating success from failure. The AI infrastructure reckoning: Optimizing compute strategy in the age of inference economics. Token costs have dropped 280-fold in two years; yet some enterprises are seeing monthly bills in the tens of millions. Usage exploded faster than costs declined. Organizations are discovering their existing infrastructure strategies aren't designed to scale AI to production-scale deployment. They're shifting from cloud-first to strategic hybrid: cloud for elasticity, on-premises for consistency, and edge for immediacy. The great rebuild: Architecting an AI-native tech organization. AI is restructuring tech organizations, making them leaner, faster, and more strategic. Only 1% of IT leaders surveyed by Deloitte reported that no major operating model changes were underway. Leaders are shifting from incremental IT management to orchestrating human-agent teams, with CIOs becoming AI evangelists. Success requires bold reimagination: modular architectures, embedded governance, and perpetual evolution as core capabilities. The AI dilemma: Securing and leveraging AI for cyber defense. The technology meant to give businesses an advantage is becoming the target used against them. AT&T\u2019s chief information security officer captured the challenge: \u201cWhat we\u2019re experiencing today is no different than what we\u2019ve experienced in the past. The only difference with AI is speed and impact.\u201d Organizations must secure AI across four domains\u2014data, models, applications, and infrastructure\u2014but they also have the opportunity to use AI-powered defenses to fight threats operating at machine speed. Throughout this year\u2019s report, you\u2019ll meet technology leaders successfully navigating this sea change. They don\u2019t have all the answers, but there are noticeable patterns as they light the way forward. They lead with problems, not technology. Broadcom\u2019s CIO: \u201cWithout focusing on a specific business problem and the value you want to derive, it could be easy to invest in AI and receive no return.\u201d Specifically, their biggest problems. UiPath CEO: \u201cRather than getting stuck in a cycle of perpetual proofs of concept, consider attacking your biggest problem and going for a big outcome.\u201d They prioritize velocity over perfection. Western Digital\u2019s CIO: \u201cWe\u2019d rather fail fast on small pilots than miss the wave entirely.\u201d They design with people, not just for them. Walmart involved store associates in building its scheduling app, which includes shift swapping, schedule visibility, and employee control. The result: Scheduling time dropped from 90 minutes to 30 minutes, and people actually used the app. They treat change as continuous. Coca-Cola\u2019s CIO described their journey as moving from \u201cWhat can we do?\u201d to \u201cWhat should we do?\u201d That shift\u2014from capability-first to need-first\u2014is what separates productive experimentation from pilot purgatory. I\u2019ve tracked technology evolution long enough to recognize the patterns. The internet changed everything. Mobile reshaped consumer behavior. Cloud computing was transformative. But this moment is different. It\u2019s not just that AI is powerful. It\u2019s that the S-curves are compressing. The distance between emerging and mainstream is collapsing. Organizations built for sequential improvement can\u2019t compete with those operating in continuous learning loops. The traditional playbook assumed you had time to get it right. That assumption no longer holds. The organizations that succeed will probably not be those with the most sophisticated technology. They\u2019ll be those with the courage to redesign rather than automate, the discipline to connect every investment to business outcomes, and the velocity to execute before the window closes. Innovation compounds. The gap between laggards and leaders grows exponentially. How you respond determines which side of that gap you\u2019re on. But you don\u2019t have to navigate this alone. We hope this year\u2019s publication reminds you that everyone\u2019s facing this rapid pace of change, and together, we can shape what comes next.",
