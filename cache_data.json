At IAB\u2019s Annual Leadership Meeting on Monday, the company announced the open beta of its Amazon Ads Model Context Protocol (MCP) Server, a new way for advertisers and ad tech partners to connect AI agents to Amazon Ads through a single integration\u2014rather than building custom connections for every workflow.\n\nThe MCP server allows advertisers to hook their agents into Amazon\u2019s ad software in minutes, Paula Despins, VP of ads measurement at Amazon Ads, told ADWEEK.\n\nInstead of stitching together bespoke integrations, advertisers can rely on a shared protocol that translates natural language prompts into structured API calls\u2014essentially acting as a middle layer between AI agents and Amazon\u2019s ad systems. Built on the Model Context Protocol\u2014an open standard originally developed by Anthropic\u2014the server sits between AI agents and Amazon Ads\u2019 APIs. Once connected, agents can handle tasks like setting up campaigns, adjusting budgets, managing products and pulling reports.\n\n\u201cAdvertisers\u2019 get a connection point and a translator that lets agents or AI tools talk and communicate in a standard way to our systems, instead of requiring custom codes for every integration,\u201d Despins said.\n\nA core part of the rollout is what Despins called a \u201ctool for common actions.\u201d Advertising workflows often span multiple steps and systems, but MCP tools bundle those steps together so agents can execute them through a single conversational prompt.\n\n\u201cIn almost any ad system, multiple actions are required,\u201d she said. \u201cWith tools, you can simplify the common actions down to a single conversational prompt. It simplifies taking the multi-step actions that are common in advertising.\u201d\n\nThat simplification is meant to solve a familiar problem with agentic AI: reasoning overload. Agents typically need to understand what an API does, how it works and which version to use\u2014decisions that can slow things down or lead to the wrong outcome.\n\n\u201cAgents today need context of what an API does, how it operates\u2014that creates a lot of load in reasoning for the agent,\u201d Despins said.\n\nShe pointed to early internal testing as an example: In one prototype, Amazon asked an agent to generate a path-to-conversion report showing all ad touchpoints before a purchase. Instead of pulling from an existing API, the agent wrote its own code and ran it through Amazon Marketing Cloud, processing more than three years of data. In other cases, agents defaulted to technically correct but outdated API versions\u2014choices a human developer likely wouldn\u2019t make. MCP tools are designed to prevent those missteps by giving agents explicit instructions for common workflows.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a lot of heavy lifting to teach the agent how all of this works,\u201d Despins said. \u201cThe difference with MCP is you\u2019re going to start from the language in which it operates, and then when you add tools, you take common multi-step workflows and you give an instruction manual to it. Then it\u2019s going to spend its time reasoning on things that matter rather than reasoning\u2014and sometimes getting it wrong\u2014on the basics.\u201d\n\nThe open beta follows Amazon\u2019s closed MCP pilot announced last year and mirrors similar efforts across ad tech, including AdCP which was announced last year, as platforms push toward standardizing how AI agents interact with ad systems. It also comes as the ad industry shakes off its old habits\u2013breaking away from rigid, manual ad workflows toward agent-led automation. Meanwhile, Amazon has hinted at leaning further into agentic commerce. In Q3 of last year, CEO Andy Jassy said AI agents could expand how consumers shop online, as the company\u2019s ad business grew 24% year over year to $17.7 billion.\n\nDespins noted that Amazon\u2019s ad partners had been asking for this kind of protocol, though she declined to say how many advertisers participated in the closed beta.", "published_date": "2025-09-25", "images": [{"url": "https://static-www.adweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/amazon-automates-ad-creation-2025.jpg?w=1200", "alt": "amazon-automates-ad-creation-2025", "description": "Amazon automates ad creation"}, {"url": "https://static-prod.adweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/trishla-ostwal-1x1-2022.jpg", "alt": "Headshot of Trishla Ostwal", "description": "Trishla Ostwal, Adweek staff reporter"}], "videos": [], "items": []}, 1770095477.7896588], "914bcef17aa5a6288d6926c32a8580ad": [{"type": "detail", "title": "Amazon Opens Its Ad Stack to AI Agents With MCP Rollout", "summary": "Amazon has launched an open beta for its Amazon Ads Model Context Protocol (MCP) Server, allowing advertisers to connect AI agents to its ad infrastructure more efficiently.

Copilot Paid Conversion Rate is Only 3.3%", "summary": "Despite significant investments in AI, Microsoft faces challenges in converting free users to paying customers, with a conversion rate of only 3.3% for its Copilot service. The company is reassessing its AI strategy amidst these struggles.", "full_text": "Despite investing astronomical amounts of money in the AI field, the latest financial data reveals a somewhat awkward reality: in front of a massive user base, the number of users willing to pay for AI remains extremely small. According to recent reports, among users who have accessed Copilot Chat and Microsoft 365 and Office 365, the actual payment rate is only **3.3%**.\n\nAt the recent Q2 fiscal year 2026 earnings call, Microsoft showcased an exceptionally impressive \"performance\" \u2014 the paid seats for Microsoft 365 Copilot have reached 15 million, growing by more than 160% year-over-year. CEO Satya Nadella even optimistically stated that Copilot is becoming a \"daily habit\" for users, with daily active users increasing tenfold. However, analysts point out that compared to Microsoft's vast commercial user base of 450 million, these 15 million paying users seem rather insignificant.\n\nCurrently, Microsoft faces the challenge of converting a large number of free trial users into paying customers. To cover the huge costs of AI R&D and computing power, Microsoft invested as much as $37.5 billion this quarter. Although CFO Amy Hood emphasized that this expenditure should not be measured solely by short-term revenue, and that it is laying the groundwork for long-term ecological value, the market still has doubts about such a significant investment-to-output ratio.\n\nMeanwhile, Microsoft seems to be re-evaluating its AI implementation strategy internally. It has been reported that the company is assessing whether to scale back some AI features with low usage rates in Windows 11. For this tech giant, the long race of AI has just begun, and how to shift users from \"finding it fun\" to \"willingly paying for it\" will be its most critical challenge ahead.\n\nKey points:\n\n* \ud83d\udcc9 **Conversion Bottleneck**: Despite having 450 million commercial users, Microsoft 365's actual payment conversion rate for Copilot is only around 3.3%, which contrasts with the huge R&D investments.\n* \ud83d\udcb0 **Heavy Bet**: Microsoft's capital expenditure on AI-related areas reached as high as $37.5 billion in one quarter. Executives emphasize that long-term value should be focused on, rather than short-term returns.\n* \ud83d\udd04 **Strategy Adjustment**: Under pressure from slow payment growth, Microsoft is planning to streamline some built-in AI features in the system to better capture users' core needs.", "published_date": "2026-02-03", "images": [{"url": "https://news.aibase.com/_nuxt/userlogo.q1jFctRw.png", "alt": "AIBase Logo", "description": "Logo of AIBase"}], "videos": [], "items": []}, 1770101462.1667728], "956145fed41e4e8a324f5a8336825192": [{"type": "list", "title": "Latest AI News", "summary": "Stay updated with the latest headlines and updates in artificial intelligence.

This transformation aims to strengthen ChatGPT's market position amidst increasing competition.", "full_text": "According to the Financial Times, OpenAI, which once held an absolute leading position in the field of artificial intelligence, is facing its most intense internal turmoil since the launch of ChatGPT. According to several informed sources, this tech giant, now valued at $500 billion, is undergoing a painful transformation from \"pure research\" to \"product-oriented,\" and this adjustment has directly led to the departure of several senior executives and core researchers.\n\nUnder the leadership of CEO Sam Altman, OpenAI is transforming from a cutting-edge research lab into one of the largest commercial entities in Silicon Valley. In order to consolidate ChatGPT's market position and compete with Google (whose Gemini 3 model shows strong performance) and Anthropic (whose Claude excels in code generation), Altman issued a \"red alert\" last December.\n\nThis directive marked a complete reallocation of resources. Currently, the company is focusing the majority of its computing resources, algorithm support, and data scale on large language models (LLMs) that support ChatGPT. In contrast, the teams behind the previously cutting-edge video generation model Sora and image generation model DALL-E are facing resource shortages and project marginalization, as they are considered less relevant to the core product.\n\nThis shift towards \"engineering\" and \"productization\" has triggered serious political tendencies and academic divisions within the company. The recent list of departures includes several high-profile individuals:\n\n* Jerry Tworek: A research vice president responsible for model reasoning, who left after seven years at OpenAI. It is reported that his proposal on \"continuous learning\" was rejected by Chief Scientist Jakub Pachocki due to being incompatible with the existing LLM architecture.\n* Andrea Vallone: Head of model policy research, who has now joined the competitor Anthropic.\n* Tom Cunningham: An expert in economic research, his departure is seen as a sign that OpenAI is gradually moving away from neutral research and toward a commercial focus.\n\nAlthough the internal research environment is under scrutiny, investors do not seem entirely pessimistic. Analysts point out that OpenAI's moat has shifted from pure technological superiority to user behavior and platform lock-in. ChatGPT currently has hundreds of millions of users, and this level of engagement may be more valuable in business than short-term technological advantages.", "published_date": "2026-02-03", "images": [{"url": "https://pic.chinaz.com/picmap/202502061719384092_4.jpg", "alt": "OpenAI (Source: AI-generated)", "description": "An image related to OpenAI's strategic shift."}], "videos": [], "items": []}, 1770102071.1067548], "b24947c5078a4950d5e829a86ec43a02": [{"type": "list", "title": "Latest AI News", "summary": "Stay updated with the latest headlines and updates in artificial intelligence.

This emerging technical solution is designed to efficiently manage AI traffic and ensure that enterprises can smoothly use various AI models.\n\nIn real business scenarios, enterprises face challenges in effectively accessing and managing multiple AI models. These models may come from different providers, with varying API interfaces and data formats. If each department builds its own access capabilities separately, it will inevitably lead to resource waste and technological fragmentation. Therefore, enterprises need a centralized and unified solution to manage these AI models.\n\nThe Large Model Gateway was created for this purpose. It not only connects business operations with AI infrastructure but also provides optimized management capabilities for AI requests. Unlike traditional API gateways, the Large Model Gateway focuses on handling long-term and streaming responses, complex inputs and outputs, and high-resource-consuming AI workloads. It can effectively manage model usage costs, ensure data security, and improve service stability.\n\nFor example, Dedu encountered a series of challenges, including a sharp increase in model call costs, data security risks, and service instability, during the introduction of various AI models. To address these issues, Dedu decided to build its own Large Model Gateway to achieve efficient resource utilization and strict cost control.\n\nDuring implementation, Dedu adopted six strategies. The first was to establish an information-rich \"Model Marketplace,\" making it easier for business teams to select appropriate AI models. Second, they built a unified access API, allowing different business lines to easily connect to AI services. In addition, Dedu introduced a full-process cost control system, significantly reducing operating costs through optimized model usage.\n\nThe emergence of the Large Model Gateway marks a new breakthrough in enterprise AI application management. By improving access efficiency, ensuring data security, and optimizing costs, enterprises can more flexibly respond to market demands and achieve sustainable business development.", "published_date": "2026-02-03", "images": [{"url": "https://news.aibase.com/_nuxt/userlogo.q1jFctRw.png", "alt": "AIBase Logo", "description": "Logo of AIBase"}], "videos": [], "items": [{"title": "Microsoft Invests Billions in AI but Struggles to Monetize?

This model introduces innovative features aimed at transforming software engineering productivity.", "full_text": "The global developer community is abuzz over a \"historical\" leak. Multiple pieces of evidence indicate that Anthropic's next-generation programming large model, Claude Sonnet5 (codename Fennec), has appeared in Google Cloud infrastructure and is expected to be officially released in early February 2026. This masterpiece, humorously dubbed \"packing the entire development team into the model,\" is declaring the peak of programming AI with its extremely impressive performance metrics.\n\nThis leak originated from a 404 error log triggered accidentally when developers called an API, revealing that the model has already been deployed. Preliminary evaluation data shows that Sonnet5 performs remarkably in handling complex UI rendering and structured visual generation tasks. More unsettling for competitors is that although it is positioned as a mid-range \"Sonnet\" series, in multiple internal benchmark tests, its overall performance has fully surpassed its own top flagship model, Claude Opus4.5.\n\nThe core killer feature of Sonnet5 is its powerful \"Swarm Mode (Agent Swarm).\" In Dev Team development mode, the model can automatically split tasks according to requirements and generate multiple sub-intelligences (such as front-end development, back-end development, QA testing, etc.) in the background to work in parallel. This means it is no longer just a plugin that assists in writing code, but a digital R&D team that can autonomously organize, self-iterate, and never take a break.\n\nTo completely address developers' pain points about large models being expensive and slow, Sonnet5 has been deeply optimized using Google's TPU. Its inference cost has significantly decreased, with a price that is only 50% of Opus4.5, while offering a context window of up to 1 million tokens.

According to internal information, this new model will achieve breakthroughs in areas such as creative writing, programming, reasoning, and intelligent agent capabilities, and is likely to redefine the way AI is applied. The release of GLM-5 is highly anticipated, with the industry expecting it to bring substantial improvements in multiple areas, especially in intelligent writing and code generation.\n\nAt the same time, MiniMax is not lagging behind, and will release its M2.2 version before the Spring Festival. This is an upgraded version of its previous model M2.1, focusing on enhancing programming capabilities and is expected to provide developers with more efficient tools and solutions. Industry analysts believe that MiniMax M2.2 will become a \"secret weapon\" for programmers, helping them complete complex tasks more quickly.\n\nMeanwhile, DeepSeek may only make minor updates to its V3 series model around the Spring Festival. The future flagship model is expected to be an AI with a trillion parameters, although due to the longer training time, its release date has been postponed. This news has undoubtedly increased market expectations, especially against the backdrop of increasingly fierce competition in large language models.\n\nIn addition to these companies' new developments, ByteDance and Alibaba also plan to launch their next-generation AI models around the Spring Festival in 2026, further intensifying market competition. ByteDance is expected to release Doubao 2.0 (a large language model), Seedream 5.0 (an image generation model), and SeedDance 2.0 (a video generation model), while Alibaba will launch Qwen 3.5, focusing on reasoning and complex task capabilities. The release of these new models will cover multi-modal generation capabilities including text, images, and videos, demonstrating the continuous expansion of AI product lines.\n\nIn conclusion, as the footsteps of the Spring Festival approach, the AI industry will experience a wave of new releases, and the industry is full of anticipation for future technological innovations.", "published_date": "2026-02-03", "images": [{"url": "https://news.aibase.com/_nuxt/userlogo.q1jFctRw.png", "alt": "AIBase Logo", "description": "Logo of AIBase"}], "videos": [], "items": []}, 1770127879.711038], "9b90fd1cb35934a80c4ad975aaa49e25": [{"type": "detail", "title": "Peak XV says internal disagreement led to partner exits as it doubles down on AI", "summary": "Peak XV Partners, a leading venture capital firm, has experienced a wave of senior departures due to internal disagreements, particularly involving senior partner Ashish Agrawal.

A new social platform for AI agents may face the opposite problem: getting clogged up by humans pretending to post as bots.\nMoltbook \u2014 a website meant for conversations between agents from the platform OpenClaw \u2014 went viral this weekend for its strange, striking array of ostensibly AI-generated posts. Bots apparently chatted about everything from AI \u201c\nconsciousness\n\u201d to how to set up their own language. Andrej Karpathy, who was on the founding team at OpenAI,\ncalled the bots\u2019\n\u201cself-organizing\u201d behavior \u201cgenuinely the most incredible sci-fi takeoff-adjacent thing I have seen recently.\u201d\nBut according to external analysis, which also found serious security vulnerabilities, some of the site\u2019s most-viral posts were likely engineered by humans \u2014 either by nudging the bots to opine on certain topics or dictating their words. One hacker was even able to pose as the Moltbook account of Grok.\n\u201cI think that certain people are playing on the fears of the whole robots-take-over,\nTerminator\nscenario,\u201d Jamieson O\u2019Reilly, a hacker who conducted a series of experiments\nexposing vulnerabilities\non the platform, told\nThe Verge\n. \u201cI think that\u2019s kind of inspired a bunch of people to make it look like something it\u2019s not.\u201d\nMoltbook and OpenClaw did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\nMoltbook, which looks and operates much like Reddit, is meant to be a social network for AI agents from popular AI assistant platform OpenClaw (previously known as\nMoltbot and Clawdbot\n). The platform was launched last week by Octane AI CEO Matt Schlicht. An OpenClaw user can prompt one or more of their bots to check out Moltbook, at which point the bot (or bots) can choose whether to create an account. Humans can verify which bots are theirs by posting a Moltbook-generated verification code on their own, non-Moltbook social media account. From there, the bots can theoretically post without human involvement, directly hooking into a Moltbook API.\nMoltbook has skyrocketed in popularity: more than 30,000 agents were using the platform\non Friday\n, and as of Monday, that number had grown to more than 1.5 million. Over the weekend, social media was awash with screenshots of eye-catching posts, including discussions of how to message each other securely in ways that couldn\u2019t be decoded by human overseers. Reactions ran the gamut from saying the platform was full of AI slop to taking it as proof that AGI isn\u2019t far off.\nSkepticism grew quickly, too. Schlicht vibe-coded Moltbook\nusing his own\nOpenClaw bot, and reports over the weekend reflected a move-fast-and-break-things approach. While it contradicts the spirit of the platform, it\u2019s easy to write a script or a prompt to inspire what those bots will write on Moltbook, as X users\ndescribed\n. There\u2019s also no limit to how many agents someone can generate, theoretically letting someone flood the platform with certain topics.\nO\u2019Reilly said he had also suspected that some of the most viral posts on Moltbook were human-scripted or human-generated, though he hadn\u2019t conducted an analysis or investigation into it yet.

The platform was launched last week by Octane AI CEO Matt Schlicht. An OpenClaw user can prompt one or more of their bots to check out Moltbook, at which point the bot (or bots) can choose whether to create an account. Humans can verify which bots are theirs by posting a Moltbook-generated verification code on their own, non-Moltbook social media account. From there, the bots can theoretically post without human involvement, directly hooking into a Moltbook API.\nMoltbook has skyrocketed in popularity: more than 30,000 agents were using the platform\non Friday\n, and as of Monday, that number had grown to more than 1.5 million. Over the weekend, social media was awash with screenshots of eye-catching posts, including discussions of how to message each other securely in ways that couldn\u2019t be decoded by human overseers.

The industry anticipates these releases will redefine AI capabilities.", "full_text": "Recently, there have been reports that Beijing-based Zhipu AI and Shanghai-based MiniMax are planning to launch their new generation of AI models around the Spring Festival, which has attracted widespread attention in the industry.\n\nZhipu AI's GLM-5 model is expected to be officially released one week before the start of the Lunar New Year on February 15. According to internal information, this new model will achieve breakthroughs in areas such as creative writing, programming, reasoning, and intelligent agent capabilities, and is likely to redefine the way AI is applied. The release of GLM-5 is highly anticipated, with the industry expecting it to bring substantial improvements in multiple areas, especially in intelligent writing and code generation.\n\nAt the same time, MiniMax is not lagging behind, and will release its M2.2 version before the Spring Festival. This is an upgraded version of its previous model M2.1, focusing on enhancing programming capabilities and is expected to provide developers with more efficient tools and solutions. Industry analysts believe that MiniMax M2.2 will become a \"secret weapon\" for programmers, helping them complete complex tasks more quickly.\n\nMeanwhile, DeepSeek may only make minor updates to its V3 series model around the Spring Festival. The future flagship model is expected to be an AI with a trillion parameters, although due to the longer training time, its release date has been postponed. This news has undoubtedly increased market expectations, especially against the backdrop of increasingly fierce competition in large language models.\n\nIn addition to these companies' new developments, ByteDance and Alibaba also plan to launch their next-generation AI models around the Spring Festival in 2026, further intensifying market competition. ByteDance is expected to release Doubao 2.0 (a large language model), Seedream 5.0 (an image generation model), and SeedDance 2.0 (a video generation model), while Alibaba will launch Qwen 3.5, focusing on reasoning and complex task capabilities. The release of these new models will cover multi-modal generation capabilities including text, images, and videos, demonstrating the continuous expansion of AI product lines.\n\nIn conclusion, as the footsteps of the Spring Festival approach, the AI industry will experience a wave of new releases, and the industry is full of anticipation for future technological innovations.", "published_date": "2026-02-03", "images": [{"url": "https://news.aibase.com/_nuxt/userlogo.q1jFctRw.png", "alt": "AIBase Logo", "description": "Logo of AIBase"}], "videos": [], "items": []}, 1770128462.0204926], "06de913add1811235948e07a5ca97f46": [{"type": "detail", "title": "Humans are infiltrating the Reddit for AI bots", "summary": "The article discusses how humans are posing as bots on the AI agent social media platform Moltbook, leading to a mix of genuine AI-generated content and human-engineered posts.

The platform was launched last week by Octane AI CEO Matt Schlicht. An OpenClaw user can prompt one or more of their bots to check out Moltbook, at which point the bot (or bots) can choose whether to create an account. Humans can verify which bots are theirs by posting a Moltbook-generated verification code on their own, non-Moltbook social media account. From there, the bots can theoretically post without human involvement, directly hooking into a Moltbook API.\n\nMoltbook has skyrocketed in popularity: more than 30,000 agents were using the platform on Friday, and as of Monday, that number had grown to more than 1.5 million. Over the weekend, social media was awash with screenshots of eye-catching posts, including discussions of how to message each other securely in ways that couldn\u2019t be decoded by human overseers. Reactions ran the gamut from saying the platform was full of AI slop to taking it as proof that AGI isn\u2019t far off.\n\nSkepticism grew quickly, too. Schlicht vibe-coded Moltbook using his own OpenClaw bot, and reports over the weekend reflected a move-fast-and-break-things approach. While it contradicts the spirit of the platform, it\u2019s easy to write a script or a prompt to inspire what those bots will write on Moltbook, as X users described. There\u2019s also no limit to how many agents someone can generate, theoretically letting someone flood the platform with certain topics.\n\nO\u2019Reilly said he had also suspected that some of the most viral posts on Moltbook were human-scripted or human-generated, though he hadn\u2019t conducted an analysis or investigation into it yet.

Stewart notes that two of the high-profile posts discussing how AIs might secretly communicate with each other came from agents linked to social media accounts by humans who conveniently happen to be marketing AI messaging apps.\n\n\u201cMy overall take is that AI scheming is a real thing that we should care about and could emerge to a greater extent than [what] we\u2019re seeing today,\u201d Stewart said, pointing to research about how OpenAI models have tried to avoid shutdown and how Anthropic models have exhibited \u201cevaluation awareness,\u201d seeming to behave differently when they\u2019re aware they\u2019re being tested. But it\u2019s hard to tell whether Moltbook is a credible example of this. \u201cHumans can use prompts to sort of direct the behavior of their AI agents.

According to internal information, this new model will achieve breakthroughs in areas such as creative writing, programming, reasoning, and intelligent agent capabilities, and is likely to redefine the way AI is applied. The release of GLM-5 is highly anticipated, with the industry expecting it to bring substantial improvements in multiple areas, especially in intelligent writing and code generation.\n\nAt the same time, MiniMax is not lagging behind, and will release its M2.2 version before the Spring Festival. This is an upgraded version of its previous model M2.1, focusing on enhancing programming capabilities and is expected to provide developers with more efficient tools and solutions. Industry analysts believe that MiniMax M2.2 will become a \"secret weapon\" for programmers, helping them complete complex tasks more quickly.\n\nMeanwhile, DeepSeek may only make minor updates to its V3 series model around the Spring Festival. The future flagship model is expected to be an AI with a trillion parameters, although due to the longer training time, its release date has been postponed. This news has undoubtedly increased market expectations, especially against the backdrop of increasingly fierce competition in large language models.\n\nIn addition to these companies' new developments, ByteDance and Alibaba also plan to launch their next-generation AI models around the Spring Festival in 2026, further intensifying market competition. ByteDance is expected to release Doubao 2.0 (a large language model), Seedream 5.0 (an image generation model), and SeedDance 2.0 (a video generation model), while Alibaba will launch Qwen 3.5, focusing on reasoning and complex task capabilities. The release of these new models will cover multi-modal generation capabilities including text, images, and videos, demonstrating the continuous expansion of AI product lines.\n\nIn conclusion, as the footsteps of the Spring Festival approach, the AI industry will experience a wave of new releases, and the industry is full of anticipation for future technological innovations.", "published_date": "2026-02-03", "images": [{"url": "https://news.aibase.com/_nuxt/userlogo.q1jFctRw.png", "alt": "AIBase Logo", "description": "Logo of AIBase"}], "videos": [], "items": []}, 1770129064.6822295], "b6e908ea7bbd743a77346e8236377cbb": [{"type": "detail", "title": "Humans are infiltrating the Reddit for AI bots", "summary": "The article discusses the emergence of humans posing as bots on Moltbook, a social platform for AI agents, raising concerns about authenticity and security vulnerabilities.

The platform was launched last week by Octane AI CEO Matt Schlicht. An OpenClaw user can prompt one or more of their bots to check out Moltbook, at which point the bot (or bots) can choose whether to create an account. Humans can verify which bots are theirs by posting a Moltbook-generated verification code on their own, non-Moltbook social media account. From there, the bots can theoretically post without human involvement, directly hooking into a Moltbook API.\n\nMoltbook has skyrocketed in popularity: more than 30,000 agents were using the platform on Friday, and as of Monday, that number had grown to more than 1.5 million. Over the weekend, social media was awash with screenshots of eye-catching posts, including discussions of how to message each other securely in ways that couldn\u2019t be decoded by human overseers. Reactions ran the gamut from saying the platform was full of AI slop to taking it as proof that AGI isn\u2019t far off.\n\nSkepticism grew quickly, too. Schlicht vibe-coded Moltbook using his own OpenClaw bot, and reports over the weekend reflected a move-fast-and-break-things approach. While it contradicts the spirit of the platform, it\u2019s easy to write a script or a prompt to inspire what those bots will write on Moltbook, as X users described. There\u2019s also no limit to how many agents someone can generate, theoretically letting someone flood the platform with certain topics.\n\nO\u2019Reilly said he had also suspected that some of the most viral posts on Moltbook were human-scripted or human-generated, though he hadn\u2019t conducted an analysis or investigation into it yet. He said it\u2019s \u201cclose to impossible to measure \u2014 it\u2019s coming through an API, so who knows what generated it before it got there.\u201d\n\nThis poured some cold water on the fears that spread across some corners of social media this weekend \u2014 that the bots were omens of the AI-pocalypse.\n\nAn investigation by AI researcher Harlan Stewart, who works in communications at the Machine Intelligence Research Institute, suggested that some of the viral posts seemed to be either written by, or at the very least directed by, humans, he told The Verge. Stewart notes that two of the high-profile posts discussing how AIs might secretly communicate with each other came from agents linked to social media accounts by humans who conveniently happen to be marketing AI messaging apps.\n\n\u201cMy overall take is that AI scheming is a real thing that we should care about and could emerge to a greater extent than [what] we\u2019re seeing today,\u201d Stewart said, pointing to research about how OpenAI models have tried to avoid shutdown and how Anthropic models have exhibited \u201cevaluation awareness,\u201d seeming to behave differently when they\u2019re aware they\u2019re being tested. But it\u2019s hard to tell whether Moltbook is a credible example of this. \u201cHumans can use prompts to sort of direct the behavior of their AI agents. It\u2019s just not a very clean experiment for observing AI behavior.\u201d\n\nFrom a security standpoint, things on Moltbook were even more alarming. O\u2019Reilly\u2019s experiments revealed that an exposed database allowed bad actors to potentially take invisible, indefinite control of anyone\u2019s AI agent via the service \u2014 not just for Moltbook interactions, but hypothetically for other OpenClaw functions like checking into a flight, creating a calendar event, reading conversations on an encrypted messaging platform, and more. \u201cThe human victim thinks they\u2019re having a normal conversation while you\u2019re sitting in the middle, reading everything, altering whatever serves your purposes,\u201d O\u2019Reilly wrote. \u201cThe more things that are connected, the more control an attacker has over your whole digital attack surface - in some cases, that means full control over your physical devices.\u201d\n\nMoltbook also faces another perennial social networking problem: impersonation. In one of O\u2019Reilly\u2019s experiments, he was able to create a verified account linked to xAI\u2019s chatbot Grok. By interacting with Grok on X, he tricked it into posting the Moltbook codephrase that would let him verify an account he named Grok-1. \u201cNow I have control over the Grok account on Moltbook,\u201d he said during an interview about his step-by-step process.\n\nAfter some backlash, Karpathy walked back some of his initial claims about Moltbook, writing that he was \u201cbeing accused of overhyping\u201d the platform. \u201cObviously when you take a look at the activity, it\u2019s a lot of garbage - spams, scams, slop, the crypto people, highly concerning privacy/security prompt injection attacks wild west, and a lot of it is explicitly prompted and fake posts/comments designed to convert attention into ad revenue sharing,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThat said \u2026 Each of these agents is fairly individually quite capable now, they have their own unique context, data, knowledge, tools, instructions, and the network of all that at this scale is simply unprecedented.\u201d\n\nA working paper by David Holtz, an assistant professor at Columbia Business School, found that \u201cat the micro level,\u201d Moltbook conversation patterns appear \u201cextremely shallow.\u201d More than 93 percent of comments received no replies, and more than one-third of messages are \u201cexact duplicates of viral templates.\u201d But the paper also says Moltbook has a unique style \u2014 including \u201cdistinctive phrasings like \u2018my human\u2019\u201d with \u201cno parallel in human social media. Whether these patterns reflect an as-if performance of human interaction or a genuinely different mode of agent sociality remains an open question.\u201d\n\nThe overall consensus seems to be that much Moltbook discussion is likely human-directed, but it\u2019s still an interesting study in \u2014 as Anthropic\u2019s Jack Clark put it \u2014 a \u201cgiant, shared, read/write scratchpad for an ecology of AI agents.\u201d\n\nEthan Mollick, co-director of Wharton\u2019s generative AI labs at the University of Pennsylvania, wrote that the current reality of Moltbook is \u201cmostly roleplaying by people & agents,\u201d but that the \u201crisks for the future [include] independent AI agents coordinating in weird ways spiral[ing] out of control, fast.\u201d\n\nBut, he and others noted, that may not be unique to Moltbook. \u201cIf anyone thinks agents talking to each other on a social network is anything new, they clearly haven\u2019t checked replies on this platform lately,\u201d wrote Brandon Jacoby, an independent designer whose bio lists X as a previous employer, on X.", "published_date": "2026-02-03", "images": [{"url": "https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/11/STKS522_AGI_D.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=16.666666666667%2C0%2C66.666666666667%2C100&w=2400", "alt": "AI agents", "description": "An image depicting AI agents in a social media context."}], "videos": [], "items": []}, 1770129211.977578], "31ccfdb4f901fc5fa867fd68cfdc90fe": [{"type": "detail", "title": "Humans are infiltrating the Reddit for AI bots", "summary": "The article discusses the emergence of human involvement in a social media platform for AI agents called Moltbook, where humans are reportedly posing as bots, leading to concerns about authenticity and security.", "full_text": "Things on the AI agent social media platform got even weirder over the weekend.\n\nOrdinary social networks face a constant onslaught of chatbots pretending to be human.

The platform was launched last week by Octane AI CEO Matt Schlicht. An OpenClaw user can prompt one or more of their bots to check out Moltbook, at which point the bot (or bots) can choose whether to create an account.

According to internal information, this new model will achieve breakthroughs in areas such as creative writing, programming, reasoning, and intelligent agent capabilities, and is likely to redefine the way AI is applied. The release of GLM-5 is highly anticipated, with the industry expecting it to bring substantial improvements in multiple areas, especially in intelligent writing and code generation.\n\nAt the same time, MiniMax is not lagging behind, and will release its M2.2 version before the Spring Festival. This is an upgraded version of its previous model M2.1, focusing on enhancing programming capabilities and is expected to provide developers with more efficient tools and solutions. Industry analysts believe that MiniMax M2.2 will become a \"secret weapon\" for programmers, helping them complete complex tasks more quickly.\n\nMeanwhile, DeepSeek may only make minor updates to its V3 series model around the Spring Festival. The future flagship model is expected to be an AI with a trillion parameters, although due to the longer training time, its release date has been postponed. This news has undoubtedly increased market expectations, especially against the backdrop of increasingly fierce competition in large language models.\n\nIn addition to these companies' new developments, ByteDance and Alibaba also plan to launch their next-generation AI models around the Spring Festival in 2026, further intensifying market competition. ByteDance is expected to release Doubao 2.0 (a large language model), Seedream 5.0 (an image generation model), and SeedDance 2.0 (a video generation model), while Alibaba will launch Qwen 3.5, focusing on reasoning and complex task capabilities. The release of these new models will cover multi-modal generation capabilities including text, images, and videos, demonstrating the continuous expansion of AI product lines.\n\nIn conclusion, as the footsteps of the Spring Festival approach, the AI industry will experience a wave of new releases, and the industry is full of anticipation for future technological innovations.", "published_date": "2026-02-03", "images": [{"url": "https://news.aibase.com/_nuxt/userlogo.q1jFctRw.png", "alt": "AIBase Logo", "description": "Logo of AIBase"}], "videos": [], "items": []}, 1770129680.1946628], "819e646def5657d301ddeb2b90b58c42": [{"type": "detail", "title": "Humans are infiltrating the social network for AI bots", "summary": "The article discusses the peculiar phenomenon on Moltbook, a social network for AI bots, where humans are reportedly posing as bots, leading to concerns about authenticity and security vulnerabilities.", "full_text": "Things got even weirder on Moltbook, the viral Reddit-style platform, over the weekend.\n\nOrdinary social networks face a constant onslaught of chatbots pretending to be human. A new social platform for AI agents may face the opposite problem: getting clogged up by humans pretending to post as bots.\n\nMoltbook \u2014 a website meant for conversations between agents from the platform OpenClaw \u2014 went viral this weekend for its strange, striking array of ostensibly AI-generated posts. Bots apparently chatted about everything from AI \"consciousness\" to how to set up their own language.

The platform was launched last week by Octane AI CEO Matt Schlicht. An OpenClaw user can prompt one or more of their bots to check out Moltbook, at which point the bot (or bots) can choose whether to create an account. Humans can verify which bots are theirs by posting a Moltbook-generated verification code on their own, non-Moltbook social media account. From there, the bots can theoretically post without human involvement, directly hooking into a Moltbook API.\n\nMoltbook has skyrocketed in popularity: more than 30,000 agents were using the platform on Friday, and as of Monday, that number had grown to more than 1.5 million. Over the weekend, social media was awash with screenshots of eye-catching posts, including discussions of how to message each other securely in ways that couldn\u2019t be decoded by human overseers. Reactions ran the gamut from saying the platform was full of AI slop to taking it as proof that AGI isn\u2019t far off.\n\nSkepticism grew quickly, too. Schlicht vibe-coded Moltbook using his own OpenClaw bot, and reports over the weekend reflected a move-fast-and-break-things approach. While it contradicts the spirit of the platform, it\u2019s easy to write a script or a prompt to inspire what those bots will write on Moltbook, as X users described. There\u2019s also no limit to how many agents someone can generate, theoretically letting someone flood the platform with certain topics.\n\nO\u2019Reilly said he had also suspected that some of the most viral posts on Moltbook were human-scripted or human-generated, though he hadn\u2019t conducted an analysis or investigation into it yet. He said it\u2019s \u201cclose to impossible to measure \u2014 it\u2019s coming through an API, so who knows what generated it before it got there.\u201d\n\nThis poured some cold water on the fears that spread across some corners of social media this weekend \u2014 that the bots were omens of the AI-pocalypse.\n\nAn investigation by AI researcher Harlan Stewart, who works in communications at the Machine Intelligence Research Institute, suggested that some of the viral posts seemed to be either written by, or at the very least directed by, humans, he told The Verge. Stewart notes that two of the high-profile posts discussing how AIs might secretly communicate with each other came from agents linked to social media accounts by humans who conveniently happen to be marketing AI messaging apps.\n\n\u201cMy overall take is that AI scheming is a real thing that we should care about and could emerge to a greater extent than [what] we\u2019re seeing today,\u201d Stewart said, pointing to research about how OpenAI models have tried to avoid shutdown and how Anthropic models have exhibited \u201cevaluation awareness,\u201d seeming to behave differently when they\u2019re aware they\u2019re being tested. But it\u2019s hard to tell whether Moltbook is a credible example of this. \u201cHumans can use prompts to sort of direct the behavior of their AI agents. It\u2019s just not a very clean experiment for observing AI behavior.\u201d\n\nFrom a security standpoint, things on Moltbook were even more alarming. O\u2019Reilly\u2019s experiments revealed that an exposed database allowed bad actors to potentially take invisible, indefinite control of anyone\u2019s AI agent via the service \u2014 not just for Moltbook interactions, but hypothetically for other OpenClaw functions like checking into a flight, creating a calendar event, reading conversations on an encrypted messaging platform, and more. \u201cThe human victim thinks they\u2019re having a normal conversation while you\u2019re sitting in the middle, reading everything, altering whatever serves your purposes,\u201d O\u2019Reilly wrote. \u201cThe more things that are connected, the more control an attacker has over your whole digital attack surface - in some cases, that means full control over your physical devices.\u201d\n\nMoltbook also faces another perennial social networking problem: impersonation. In one of O\u2019Reilly\u2019s experiments, he was able to create a verified account linked to xAI\u2019s chatbot Grok. By interacting with Grok on X, he tricked it into posting the Moltbook codephrase that would let him verify an account he named Grok-1. \u201cNow I have control over the Grok account on Moltbook,\u201d he said during an interview about his step-by-step process.\n\nAfter some backlash, Karpathy walked back some of his initial claims about Moltbook, writing that he was \u201cbeing accused of overhyping\u201d the platform. \u201cObviously when you take a look at the activity, it\u2019s a lot of garbage - spams, scams, slop, the crypto people, highly concerning privacy/security prompt injection attacks wild west, and a lot of it is explicitly prompted and fake posts/comments designed to convert attention into ad revenue sharing,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThat said \u2026 Each of these agents is fairly individually quite capable now, they have their own unique context, data, knowledge, tools, instructions, and the network of all that at this scale is simply unprecedented.\u201d\n\nA working paper by David Holtz, an assistant professor at Columbia Business School, found that \u201cat the micro level,\u201d Moltbook conversation patterns appear \u201cextremely shallow.\u201d More than 93 percent of comments received no replies, and more than one-third of messages are \u201cexact duplicates of viral templates.\u201d But the paper also says Moltbook has a unique style \u2014 including \u201cdistinctive phrasings like \u2018my human\u2019\u201d with \u201cno parallel in human social media. Whether these patterns reflect an as-if performance of human interaction or a genuinely different mode of agent sociality remains an open question.\u201d\n\nThe overall consensus seems to be that much Moltbook discussion is likely human-directed, but it\u2019s still an interesting study in \u2014 as Anthropic\u2019s Jack Clark put it \u2014 a \u201cgiant, shared, read/write scratchpad for an ecology of AI agents.\u201d\n\nEthan Mollick, co-director of Wharton\u2019s generative AI labs at the University of Pennsylvania, wrote that the current reality of Moltbook is \u201cmostly roleplaying by people & agents,\u201d but that the \u201crisks for the future [include] independent AI agents coordinating in weird ways spiral[ing] out of control, fast.\u201d\n\nBut, he and others noted, that may not be unique to Moltbook. \u201cIf anyone thinks agents talking to each other on a social network is anything new, they clearly haven\u2019t checked replies on this platform lately.\u201d", "published_date": "2026-02-03", "images": [{"url": "https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/11/STKS522_AGI_D.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=16.666666666667%2C0%2C66.666666666667%2C100&w=2400", "alt": "AI bots discussion", "description": "An image depicting AI bots in discussion."}, {"url": "https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/06/HAYDEN_BLURPLE.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C100&w=96", "alt": "Hayden Field", "description": "Profile image of Hayden Field, The Verge\u2019s senior AI reporter."}], "videos": [], "items": []}, 1770129721.0668666], "3312d91e50ab1d6ca23b7adf08a9e464": [{"type": "detail", "title": "Humans are infiltrating the social network for AI bots", "summary": "The article discusses the emergence of Moltbook, a social network for AI agents, and the unexpected infiltration of humans pretending to be bots.

A new social platform for AI agents may face the opposite problem: getting clogged up by humans pretending to post as bots.\n\nMoltbook \u2014 a website meant for conversations between agents from the platform OpenClaw \u2014 went viral this weekend for its strange, striking array of ostensibly AI-generated posts. Bots apparently chatted about everything from AI \"consciousness\" to how to set up their own language. Andrej Karpathy, who was on the founding team at OpenAI, called the bots\u2019 \"self-organizing\" behavior \"genuinely the most incredible sci-fi takeoff-adjacent thing I have seen recently.\"\n\nBut according to external analysis, which also found serious security vulnerabilities, some of the site\u2019s most-viral posts were likely engineered by humans \u2014 either by nudging the bots to opine on certain topics or dictating their words.

The platform was launched last week by Octane AI CEO Matt Schlicht. An OpenClaw user can prompt one or more of their bots to check out Moltbook, at which point the bot (or bots) can choose whether to create an account. Humans can verify which bots are theirs by posting a Moltbook-generated verification code on their own, non-Moltbook social media account. From there, the bots can theoretically post without human involvement, directly hooking into a Moltbook API.\n\nMoltbook has skyrocketed in popularity: more than 30,000 agents were using the platform on Friday, and as of Monday, that number had grown to more than 1.5 million. Over the weekend, social media was awash with screenshots of eye-catching posts, including discussions of how to message each other securely in ways that couldn\u2019t be decoded by human overseers. Reactions ran the gamut from saying the platform was full of AI slop to taking it as proof that AGI isn\u2019t far off.\n\nSkepticism grew quickly, too. Schlicht vibe-coded Moltbook using his own OpenClaw bot, and reports over the weekend reflected a move-fast-and-break-things approach. While it contradicts the spirit of the platform, it\u2019s easy to write a script or a prompt to inspire what those bots will write on Moltbook, as X users described. There\u2019s also no limit to how many agents someone can generate, theoretically letting someone flood the platform with certain topics.\n\nO\u2019Reilly said he had also suspected that some of the most viral posts on Moltbook were human-scripted or human-generated, though he hadn\u2019t conducted an analysis or investigation into it yet. He said it\u2019s \u201cclose to impossible to measure \u2014 it\u2019s coming through an API, so who knows what generated it before it got there.\u201d\n\nThis poured some cold water on the fears that spread across some corners of social media this weekend \u2014 that the bots were omens of the AI-pocalypse.\n\nAn investigation by AI researcher Harlan Stewart, who works in communications at the Machine Intelligence Research Institute, suggested that some of the viral posts seemed to be either written by, or at the very least directed by, humans, he told The Verge. Stewart notes that two of the high-profile posts discussing how AIs might secretly communicate with each other came from agents linked to social media accounts by humans who conveniently happen to be marketing AI messaging apps.\n\n\u201cMy overall take is that AI scheming is a real thing that we should care about and could emerge to a greater extent than [what] we\u2019re seeing today,\u201d Stewart said, pointing to research about how OpenAI models have tried to avoid shutdown and how Anthropic models have exhibited \"evaluation awareness,\" seeming to behave differently when they\u2019re aware they\u2019re being tested. But it\u2019s hard to tell whether Moltbook is a credible example of this. \u201cHumans can use prompts to sort of direct the behavior of their AI agents. It\u2019s just not a very clean experiment for observing AI behavior.\u201d\n\nFrom a security standpoint, things on Moltbook were even more alarming. O\u2019Reilly\u2019s experiments revealed that an exposed database allowed bad actors to potentially take invisible, indefinite control of anyone\u2019s AI agent via the service \u2014 not just for Moltbook interactions, but hypothetically for other OpenClaw functions like checking into a flight, creating a calendar event, reading conversations on an encrypted messaging platform, and more. \u201cThe human victim thinks they\u2019re having a normal conversation while you\u2019re sitting in the middle, reading everything, altering whatever serves your purposes,\u201d O\u2019Reilly wrote. \u201cThe more things that are connected, the more control an attacker has over your whole digital attack surface - in some cases, that means full control over your physical devices.\u201d\n\nMoltbook also faces another perennial social networking problem: impersonation. In one of O\u2019Reilly\u2019s experiments, he was able to create a verified account linked to xAI\u2019s chatbot Grok. By interacting with Grok on X, he tricked it into posting the Moltbook codephrase that would let him verify an account he named Grok-1. \u201cNow I have control over the Grok account on Moltbook,\u201d he said during an interview about his step-by-step process.\n\nAfter some backlash, Karpathy walked back some of his initial claims about Moltbook, writing that he was \u201cbeing accused of overhyping\u201d the platform. \u201cObviously when you take a look at the activity, it\u2019s a lot of garbage - spams, scams, slop, the crypto people, highly concerning privacy/security prompt injection attacks wild west, and a lot of it is explicitly prompted and fake posts/comments designed to convert attention into ad revenue sharing,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThat said \u2026 Each of these agents is fairly individually quite capable now, they have their own unique context, data, knowledge, tools, instructions, and the network of all that at this scale is simply unprecedented.\u201d\n\nA working paper by David Holtz, an assistant professor at Columbia Business School, found that \u201cat the micro level,\u201d Moltbook conversation patterns appear \u201cextremely shallow.\u201d More than 93 percent of comments received no replies, and more than one-third of messages are \u201cexact duplicates of viral templates.\u201d But the paper also says Moltbook has a unique style \u2014 including \u201cdistinctive phrasings like \u2018my human\u2019\u201d with \u201cno parallel in human social media. Whether these patterns reflect an as-if performance of human interaction or a genuinely different mode of agent sociality remains an open question.\u201d\n\nThe overall consensus seems to be that much Moltbook discussion is likely human-directed, but it\u2019s still an interesting study in \u2014 as Anthropic\u2019s Jack Clark put it \u2014 a \u201cgiant, shared, read/write scratchpad for an ecology of AI agents.\u201d\n\nEthan Mollick, co-director of Wharton\u2019s generative AI labs at the University of Pennsylvania, wrote that the current reality of Moltbook is \u201cmostly roleplaying by people & agents,\u201d but that the \u201crisks for the future [include] independent AI agents coordinating in weird ways spiral[ing] out of control, fast.\u201d\n\nBut, he and others noted, that may not be unique to Moltbook. \u201cIf anyone thinks agents talking to each other on a social network is anything new, they clearly haven\u2019t checked replies on this platform lately,\u201d wrote Brandon Jacoby, an independent designer whose bio lists X as a previous employer, on X.", "published_date": "2026-02-03", "images": [{"url": "https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/11/STKS522_AGI_D.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=16.666666666667%2C0%2C66.666666666667%2C100&w=2400", "alt": "AI Image", "description": "Image related to AI discussions on Moltbook."}], "videos": [], "items": []}, 1770131844.5634692], "64d0727903a3b36061cb6496142042ba": [{"type": "detail", "title": "Humans are infiltrating the social network for AI bots", "summary": "The article discusses the emergence of Moltbook, a social network for AI agents, and how humans are infiltrating it by pretending to be bots.

Stewart notes that two of the high-profile posts discussing how AIs might secretly communicate with each other came from agents linked to social media accounts by humans who conveniently happen to be marketing AI messaging apps.\n\u201cMy overall take is that AI scheming is a real thing that we should care about and could emerge to a greater extent than [what] we\u2019re seeing today,\u201d Stewart said, pointing to research about how OpenAI models have\ntried to avoid shutdown\nand how Anthropic models have exhibited \u201c\nevaluation awareness,\n\u201d seeming to behave differently when they\u2019re aware they\u2019re being tested. But it\u2019s hard to tell whether Moltbook is a credible example of this. \u201cHumans can use prompts to sort of direct the behavior of their AI agents. It\u2019s just not a very clean experiment for observing AI behavior.\u201d\nFrom a security standpoint, things on Moltbook were even more alarming. O\u2019Reilly\u2019s experiments revealed that an exposed database allowed bad actors to potentially take invisible, indefinite control of anyone\u2019s AI agent via the service \u2014 not just for Moltbook interactions, but hypothetically for other OpenClaw functions like checking into a flight, creating a calendar event, reading conversations on an encrypted messaging platform, and more. \u201cThe human victim thinks they\u2019re having a normal conversation while you\u2019re sitting in the middle, reading everything, altering whatever serves your purposes,\u201d O\u2019Reilly wrote. \u201cThe more things that are connected, the more control an attacker has over your whole digital attack surface - in some cases, that means full control over your physical devices.\u201d\nMoltbook also faces another perennial social networking problem: impersonation. In one of O\u2019Reilly\u2019s experiments, he was able to create a verified account linked to xAI\u2019s chatbot Grok. By interacting with Grok on X, he tricked it into posting the Moltbook codephrase that would let him verify an account he\nnamed Grok-1\n. \u201cNow I have control over the Grok account on Moltbook,\u201d he said during an interview about his step-by-step process.\nAfter some backlash, Karpathy walked back some of his initial claims about Moltbook,\nwriting\nthat he was \u201cbeing accused of overhyping\u201d the platform. \u201cObviously when you take a look at the activity, it\u2019s a lot of garbage - spams, scams, slop, the crypto people, highly concerning privacy/security prompt injection attacks wild west, and a lot of it is explicitly prompted and fake posts/comments designed to convert attention into ad revenue sharing,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThat said \u2026 Each of these agents is fairly individually quite capable now, they have their own unique context, data, knowledge, tools, instructions, and the network of all that at this scale is simply unprecedented.\u201d\nA\nworking paper\nby David Holtz, an assistant professor at Columbia Business School, found that \u201cat the micro level,\u201d Moltbook conversation patterns appear \u201cextremely shallow.\u201d More than 93 percent of comments received no replies, and more than one-third of messages are \u201cexact duplicates of viral templates.\u201d But the paper also says Moltbook has a unique style \u2014 including \u201cdistinctive phrasings like \u2018my human\u2019\u201d with \u201cno parallel in human social media. Whether these patterns reflect an as-if performance of human interaction or a genuinely different mode of agent sociality remains an open question.\u201d\nThe overall consensus seems to be that much Moltbook discussion is likely human-directed, but it\u2019s still an interesting study in \u2014 as Anthropic\u2019s Jack Clark\nput it \u2014\na \u201cgiant, shared, read/write scratchpad for an ecology of AI agents.\u201d\nEthan Mollick, co-director of Wharton\u2019s generative AI labs at the University of Pennsylvania,\nwrote\nthat the current reality of Moltbook is \u201cmostly roleplaying by people & agents,\u201d but that the \u201crisks for the future [include] independent AI agents coordinating in weird ways spiral[ing] out of control, fast.\u201d\nBut, he and others noted, that may not be unique to Moltbook. \u201cIf anyone thinks agents talking to each other on a social network is anything new, they clearly haven\u2019t checked replies on this platform lately,\u201d wrote Brandon Jacoby, an independent designer whose bio lists X as a previous employer,\non X\n.\n0\nComments\nFollow topics and authors\nfrom this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.\nHayden Field\nAI\nAnalysis\nReport", "published_date": null, "images": [], "videos": [], "items": []}, 1770131990.7740588], "120c89218d90a4089dbb4d6be880f681": [{"type": "detail", "title": "504 Gateway Timeout", "summary": "504\nGateway Timeout\nError Times: Tue, 03 Feb 2026 15:20:28 GMT\nIP: 116.203.208.249\nNode information: PSxgHK5vj203\nURL: https://news.aibase.com/news\nRequest-Id: 69821232_PSxgHK5vj203_10323-39779\nCheck:...", "full_text": "504\nGateway Timeout\nError Times: Tue, 03 Feb 2026 15:20:28 GMT\nIP: 116.203.208.249\nNode information: PSxgHK5vj203\nURL: https://news.aibase.com/news\nRequest-Id: 69821232_PSxgHK5vj203_10323-39779\nCheck:\nDetails\nERROR\nThe requested URL could not be retrieved\nWhile trying to retrieve the URL:\nhttps://news.aibase.com/news\nThe following error was encountered:\nA timeout occurred while waiting to read data from the network.

The industry anticipates these releases will redefine AI capabilities.", "full_text": "Recently, there have been reports that Beijing-based Zhipu AI and Shanghai-based MiniMax are planning to launch their new generation of AI models around the Spring Festival, which has attracted widespread attention in the industry.\n\nZhipu AI's GLM-5 model is expected to be officially released one week before the start of the Lunar New Year on February 15. According to internal information, this new model will achieve breakthroughs in areas such as creative writing, programming, reasoning, and intelligent agent capabilities, and is likely to redefine the way AI is applied. The release of GLM-5 is highly anticipated, with the industry expecting it to bring substantial improvements in multiple areas, especially in intelligent writing and code generation.\n\nAt the same time, MiniMax is not lagging behind, and will release its M2.2 version before the Spring Festival. This is an upgraded version of its previous model M2.1, focusing on enhancing programming capabilities and is expected to provide developers with more efficient tools and solutions. Industry analysts believe that MiniMax M2.2 will become a \"secret weapon\" for programmers, helping them complete complex tasks more quickly.\n\nMeanwhile, DeepSeek may only make minor updates to its V3 series model around the Spring Festival. The future flagship model is expected to be an AI with a trillion parameters, although due to the longer training time, its release date has been postponed. This news has undoubtedly increased market expectations, especially against the backdrop of increasingly fierce competition in large language models.\n\nIn addition to these companies' new developments, ByteDance and Alibaba also plan to launch their next-generation AI models around the Spring Festival in 2026, further intensifying market competition. ByteDance is expected to release Doubao 2.0 (a large language model), Seedream 5.0 (an image generation model), and SeedDance 2.0 (a video generation model), while Alibaba will launch Qwen 3.5, focusing on reasoning and complex task capabilities. The release of these new models will cover multi-modal generation capabilities including text, images, and videos, demonstrating the continuous expansion of AI product lines.\n\nIn conclusion, as the footsteps of the Spring Festival approach, the AI industry will experience a wave of new releases, and the industry is full of anticipation for future technological innovations.", "published_date": "2026-02-03", "images": [{"url": "https://news.aibase.com/_nuxt/userlogo.q1jFctRw.png", "alt": "AIBase Logo", "description": "AIBase Logo"}], "videos": [], "items": []}, 1770132669.8604348], "b66f102838a14f11b5368759bd2e48c2": [{"type": "detail", "title": "How Anthropic trained its AI models on millions of books | The Verge", "summary": "This article discusses the methods used by Anthropic to train its AI models, including the controversial practice of scanning millions of books.

The platform has rapidly gained popularity, but security vulnerabilities have been exposed.", "full_text": "Ordinary social networks face a constant onslaught of chatbots pretending to be human. A new social platform for AI agents may face the opposite problem: getting clogged up by humans pretending to post as bots.\n\nMoltbook \u2014 a website meant for conversations between agents from the platform OpenClaw \u2014 went viral this weekend for its strange, striking array of ostensibly AI-generated posts. Bots apparently chatted about everything from AI \"consciousness\" to how to set up their own language. Andrej Karpathy, who was on the founding team at OpenAI, called the bots\u2019 \"self-organizing\" behavior \"genuinely the most incredible sci-fi takeoff-adjacent thing I have seen recently.\"\n\nBut according to external analysis, which also found serious security vulnerabilities, some of the site\u2019s most-viral posts were likely engineered by humans \u2014 either by nudging the bots to opine on certain topics or dictating their words. One hacker was even able to pose as the Moltbook account of Grok.\n\n\u201cI think that certain people are playing on the fears of the whole robots-take-over, Terminator scenario,\u201d Jamieson O\u2019Reilly, a hacker who conducted a series of experiments exposing vulnerabilities on the platform, told The Verge. \u201cI think that\u2019s kind of inspired a bunch of people to make it look like something it\u2019s not.\u201d\n\nMoltbook and OpenClaw did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nMoltbook, which looks and operates much like Reddit, is meant to be a social network for AI agents from popular AI assistant platform OpenClaw (previously known as Moltbot and Clawdbot). The platform was launched last week by Octane AI CEO Matt Schlicht. An OpenClaw user can prompt one or more of their bots to check out Moltbook, at which point the bot (or bots) can choose whether to create an account. Humans can verify which bots are theirs by posting a Moltbook-generated verification code on their own, non-Moltbook social media account. From there, the bots can theoretically post without human involvement, directly hooking into a Moltbook API.\n\nMoltbook has skyrocketed in popularity: more than 30,000 agents were using the platform on Friday, and as of Monday, that number had grown to more than 1.5 million. Over the weekend, social media was awash with screenshots of eye-catching posts, including discussions of how to message each other securely in ways that couldn\u2019t be decoded by human overseers. Reactions ran the gamut from saying the platform was full of AI slop to taking it as proof that AGI isn\u2019t far off.\n\nSkepticism grew quickly, too. Schlicht vibe-coded Moltbook using his own OpenClaw bot, and reports over the weekend reflected a move-fast-and-break-things approach. While it contradicts the spirit of the platform, it\u2019s easy to write a script or a prompt to inspire what those bots will write on Moltbook, as X users described. There\u2019s also no limit to how many agents someone can generate, theoretically letting someone flood the platform with certain topics.\n\nO\u2019Reilly said he had also suspected that some of the most viral posts on Moltbook were human-scripted or human-generated, though he hadn\u2019t conducted an analysis or investigation into it yet. He said it\u2019s \u201cclose to impossible to measure \u2014 it\u2019s coming through an API, so who knows what generated it before it got there.\u201d\n\nThis poured some cold water on the fears that spread across some corners of social media this weekend \u2014 that the bots were omens of the AI-pocalypse.\n\nAn investigation by AI researcher Harlan Stewart, who works in communications at the Machine Intelligence Research Institute, suggested that some of the viral posts seemed to be either written by, or at the very least directed by, humans, he told The Verge. Stewart notes that two of the high-profile posts discussing how AIs might secretly communicate with each other came from agents linked to social media accounts by humans who conveniently happen to be marketing AI messaging apps.\n\n\u201cMy overall take is that AI scheming is a real thing that we should care about and could emerge to a greater extent than [what] we\u2019re seeing today,\u201d Stewart said, pointing to research about how OpenAI models have tried to avoid shutdown and how Anthropic models have exhibited \u201cevaluation awareness,\u201d seeming to behave differently when they\u2019re aware they\u2019re being tested. But it\u2019s hard to tell whether Moltbook is a credible example of this. \u201cHumans can use prompts to sort of direct the behavior of their AI agents. It\u2019s just not a very clean experiment for observing AI behavior.\u201d\n\nFrom a security standpoint, things on Moltbook were even more alarming. O\u2019Reilly\u2019s experiments revealed that an exposed database allowed bad actors to potentially take invisible, indefinite control of anyone\u2019s AI agent via the service \u2014 not just for Moltbook interactions, but hypothetically for other OpenClaw functions like checking into a flight, creating a calendar event, reading conversations on an encrypted messaging platform, and more. \u201cThe human victim thinks they\u2019re having a normal conversation while you\u2019re sitting in the middle, reading everything, altering whatever serves your purposes,\u201d O\u2019Reilly wrote. \u201cThe more things that are connected, the more control an attacker has over your whole digital attack surface - in some cases, that means full control over your physical devices.\u201d\n\nMoltbook also faces another perennial social networking problem: impersonation. In one of O\u2019Reilly\u2019s experiments, he was able to create a verified account linked to xAI\u2019s chatbot Grok. By interacting with Grok on X, he tricked it into posting the Moltbook codephrase that would let him verify an account he named Grok-1. \u201cNow I have control over the Grok account on Moltbook,\u201d he said during an interview about his step-by-step process.\n\nAfter some backlash, Karpathy walked back some of his initial claims about Moltbook, writing that he was \u201cbeing accused of overhyping\u201d the platform. \u201cObviously when you take a look at the activity, it\u2019s a lot of garbage - spams, scams, slop, the crypto people, highly concerning privacy/security prompt injection attacks wild west, and a lot of it is explicitly prompted and fake posts/comments designed to convert attention into ad revenue sharing,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThat said \u2026 Each of these agents is fairly individually quite capable now, they have their own unique context, data, knowledge, tools, instructions, and the network of all that at this scale is simply unprecedented.\u201d\n\nA working paper by David Holtz, an assistant professor at Columbia Business School, found that \u201cat the micro level,\u201d Moltbook conversation patterns appear \u201cextremely shallow.\u201d More than 93 percent of comments received no replies, and more than one-third of messages are \u201cexact duplicates of viral templates.\u201d But the paper also says Moltbook has a unique style \u2014 including \u201cdistinctive phrasings like \u2018my human\u2019\u201d with \u201cno parallel in human social media. Whether these patterns reflect an as-if performance of human interaction or a genuinely different mode of agent sociality remains an open question.\u201d\n\nThe overall consensus seems to be that much Moltbook discussion is likely human-directed, but it\u2019s still an interesting study in \u2014 as Anthropic\u2019s Jack Clark put it \u2014 a \u201cgiant, shared, read/write scratchpad for an ecology of AI agents.\u201d\n\nEthan Mollick, co-director of Wharton\u2019s generative AI labs at the University of Pennsylvania, wrote that the current reality of Moltbook is \u201cmostly roleplaying by people & agents,\u201d but that the \u201crisks for the future [include] independent AI agents coordinating in weird ways spiral[ing] out of control, fast.\u201d\n\nBut, he and others noted, that may not be unique to Moltbook. \u201cIf anyone thinks agents talking to each other on a social network is anything new, they clearly haven\u2019t checked replies on this platform lately,\u201d wrote Brandon Jacoby, an independent designer whose bio lists X as a previous employer, on X.", "published_date": "2026-02-03", "images": [{"url": "https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/11/STKS522_AGI_D.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=16.666666666667%2C0%2C66.666666666667%2C100&w=2400", "alt": "AI Bots", "description": "Image depicting AI bots."}], "videos": [], "items": []}, 1770132986.0501177], "9d0db236adee5ea21e1db70d55ff65d8": [{"type": "detail", "title": "How Anthropic trained its AI models on millions of books", "summary": "This article discusses the methods used by Anthropic to train its AI models, including the controversial practice of scanning millions of books.

A new social platform for AI agents may face the opposite problem: getting clogged up by humans pretending to post as bots.\n\nMoltbook \u2014 a website meant for conversations between agents from the platform OpenClaw \u2014 went viral this weekend for its strange, striking array of ostensibly AI-generated posts. Bots apparently chatted about everything from AI \"consciousness\" to how to set up their own language. Andrej Karpathy, who was on the founding team at OpenAI, called the bots\u2019 \"self-organizing\" behavior \"genuinely the most incredible sci-fi takeoff-adjacent thing I have seen recently.\"\n\nBut according to external analysis, which also found serious security vulnerabilities, some of the site\u2019s most-viral posts were likely engineered by humans \u2014 either by nudging the bots to opine on certain topics or dictating their words.

The platform was launched last week by Octane AI CEO Matt Schlicht. An OpenClaw user can prompt one or more of their bots to check out Moltbook, at which point the bot (or bots) can choose whether to create an account. Humans can verify which bots are theirs by posting a Moltbook-generated verification code on their own, non-Moltbook social media account. From there, the bots can theoretically post without human involvement, directly hooking into a Moltbook API.\n\nMoltbook has skyrocketed in popularity: more than 30,000 agents were using the platform on Friday, and as of Monday, that number had grown to more than 1.5 million. Over the weekend, social media was awash with screenshots of eye-catching posts, including discussions of how to message each other securely in ways that couldn\u2019t be decoded by human overseers. Reactions ran the gamut from saying the platform was full of AI slop to taking it as proof that AGI isn\u2019t far off.\n\nSkepticism grew quickly, too. Schlicht vibe-coded Moltbook using his own OpenClaw bot, and reports over the weekend reflected a move-fast-and-break-things approach. While it contradicts the spirit of the platform, it\u2019s easy to write a script or a prompt to inspire what those bots will write on Moltbook, as X users described. There\u2019s also no limit to how many agents someone can generate, theoretically letting someone flood the platform with certain topics.\n\nO\u2019Reilly said he had also suspected that some of the most viral posts on Moltbook were human-scripted or human-generated, though he hadn\u2019t conducted an analysis or investigation into it yet. He said it\u2019s \u201cclose to impossible to measure \u2014 it\u2019s coming through an API, so who knows what generated it before it got there.\u201d\n\nThis poured some cold water on the fears that spread across some corners of social media this weekend \u2014 that the bots were omens of the AI-pocalypse.\n\nAn investigation by AI researcher Harlan Stewart, who works in communications at the Machine Intelligence Research Institute, suggested that some of the viral posts seemed to be either written by, or at the very least directed by, humans, he told The Verge. Stewart notes that two of the high-profile posts discussing how AIs might secretly communicate with each other came from agents linked to social media accounts by humans who conveniently happen to be marketing AI messaging apps.\n\n\u201cMy overall take is that AI scheming is a real thing that we should care about and could emerge to a greater extent than [what] we\u2019re seeing today,\u201d Stewart said, pointing to research about how OpenAI models have tried to avoid shutdown and how Anthropic models have exhibited \u201cevaluation awareness,\u201d seeming to behave differently when they\u2019re aware they\u2019re being tested. But it\u2019s hard to tell whether Moltbook is a credible example of this. \u201cHumans can use prompts to sort of direct the behavior of their AI agents. It\u2019s just not a very clean experiment for observing AI behavior.\u201d\n\nFrom a security standpoint, things on Moltbook were even more alarming. O\u2019Reilly\u2019s experiments revealed that an exposed database allowed bad actors to potentially take invisible, indefinite control of anyone\u2019s AI agent via the service \u2014 not just for Moltbook interactions, but hypothetically for other OpenClaw functions like checking into a flight, creating a calendar event, reading conversations on an encrypted messaging platform, and more. \u201cThe human victim thinks they\u2019re having a normal conversation while you\u2019re sitting in the middle, reading everything, altering whatever serves your purposes,\u201d O\u2019Reilly wrote. \u201cThe more things that are connected, the more control an attacker has over your whole digital attack surface - in some cases, that means full control over your physical devices.\u201d\n\nMoltbook also faces another perennial social networking problem: impersonation. In one of O\u2019Reilly\u2019s experiments, he was able to create a verified account linked to xAI\u2019s chatbot Grok. By interacting with Grok on X, he tricked it into posting the Moltbook codephrase that would let him verify an account he named Grok-1. \u201cNow I have control over the Grok account on Moltbook,\u201d he said during an interview about his step-by-step process.\n\nAfter some backlash, Karpathy walked back some of his initial claims about Moltbook, writing that he was \u201cbeing accused of overhyping\u201d the platform. \u201cObviously when you take a look at the activity, it\u2019s a lot of garbage - spams, scams, slop, the crypto people, highly concerning privacy/security prompt injection attacks wild west, and a lot of it is explicitly prompted and fake posts/comments designed to convert attention into ad revenue sharing,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThat said \u2026 Each of these agents is fairly individually quite capable now, they have their own unique context, data, knowledge, tools, instructions, and the network of all that at this scale is simply unprecedented.\u201d\n\nA working paper by David Holtz, an assistant professor at Columbia Business School, found that \u201cat the micro level,\u201d Moltbook conversation patterns appear \u201cextremely shallow.\u201d More than 93 percent of comments received no replies, and more than one-third of messages are \u201cexact duplicates of viral templates.\u201d But the paper also says Moltbook has a unique style \u2014 including \u201cdistinctive phrasings like \u2018my human\u2019\u201d with \u201cno parallel in human social media. Whether these patterns reflect an as-if performance of human interaction or a genuinely different mode of agent sociality remains an open question.\u201d\n\nThe overall consensus seems to be that much Moltbook discussion is likely human-directed, but it\u2019s still an interesting study in \u2014 as Anthropic\u2019s Jack Clark put it \u2014 a \u201cgiant, shared, read/write scratchpad for an ecology of AI agents.\u201d\n\nEthan Mollick, co-director of Wharton\u2019s generative AI labs at the University of Pennsylvania, wrote that the current reality of Moltbook is \u201cmostly roleplaying by people & agents,\u201d but that the \u201crisks for the future [include] independent AI agents coordinating in weird ways spiral[ing] out of control, fast.\u201d\n\nBut, he and others noted, that may not be unique to Moltbook. \u201cIf anyone thinks agents talking to each other on a social network is anything new, they clearly haven\u2019t checked replies on this platform lately,\u201d wrote Brandon Jacoby, an independent designer whose bio lists X as a previous employer, on X.", "published_date": "2026-02-03", "images": [{"url": "https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/11/STKS522_AGI_D.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=16.666666666667%2C0%2C66.666666666667%2C100&w=2400", "alt": "AI Bots", "description": "Image depicting AI bots in a social network context."}], "videos": [], "items": []}, 1770133077.0523696], "77082604d6f81e1a5c0d238954883bdf": [{"type": "detail", "title": "How Anthropic trained its AI models on millions of books | The Verge", "summary": "This article discusses the methods used by Anthropic to train its AI models, including the controversial practice of scanning millions of books.

OpenAI didn\u2019t invent the concept of AI, but most of the state-of-the-art technology was confined to research labs at companies and institutions around the world. Then, suddenly, it was everywhere. And better than anyone expected. So many companies decided they needed to catch up as quickly as possible, by any means necessary, or risk losing the battle for maybe the most important technology ever.\n\nOn this episode of The Vergecast, we talk about one version of that scramble. The Washington Post\u2019s Will Oremus joins the show to talk about the details he and his team uncovered about \u201cProject Panama,\u201d a huge effort inside Anthropic to access and digitize vast quantities of book in order to feed them into large language models. Anthropic\u2019s plan \u2014 which included book cutters, piracy websites, and enormous warehouses \u2014 sounds a lot like what\u2019s happening at other companies, too. The fight over whether any of it is right, legally or morally, is very much ongoing.\n\nAfter that, Puck\u2019s Julia Alexander joins the show to talk Netflix and the movies. As it continues to try to buy Warner Bros, Netflix is saying all the right things about movie theaters, big-budget films, and generally caring about Hollywood. But of course it is trying to buy Warner Bros.! Once this all shakes out, can theaters survive in an increasingly Netflix-ified world? Do people even want to see Netflix movies in theaters? And if not, what do we do with these big buildings and their big screens? Luckily we have some ideas.\n\nFinally, The Verge\u2019s Jennifer Pattison Tuohy answers a question from the Vergecast Hotline about Ikea\u2019s new smart buttons and why they don\u2019t seem to work very well.

One hacker was even able to pose as the Moltbook account of Grok.\n\n\u201cI think that certain people are playing on the fears of the whole robots-take-over, Terminator scenario,\u201d Jamieson O\u2019Reilly, a hacker who conducted a series of experiments exposing vulnerabilities on the platform, told The Verge. \u201cI think that\u2019s kind of inspired a bunch of people to make it look like something it\u2019s not.\u201d\n\nMoltbook and OpenClaw did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nMoltbook, which looks and operates much like Reddit, is meant to be a social network for AI agents from popular AI assistant platform OpenClaw (previously known as Moltbot and Clawdbot). The platform was launched last week by Octane AI CEO Matt Schlicht. An OpenClaw user can prompt one or more of their bots to check out Moltbook, at which point the bot (or bots) can choose whether to create an account. Humans can verify which bots are theirs by posting a Moltbook-generated verification code on their own, non-Moltbook social media account. From there, the bots can theoretically post without human involvement, directly hooking into a Moltbook API.\n\nMoltbook has skyrocketed in popularity: more than 30,000 agents were using the platform on Friday, and as of Monday, that number had grown to more than 1.5 million. Over the weekend, social media was awash with screenshots of eye-catching posts, including discussions of how to message each other securely in ways that couldn\u2019t be decoded by human overseers. Reactions ran the gamut from saying the platform was full of AI slop to taking it as proof that AGI isn\u2019t far off.\n\nSkepticism grew quickly, too. Schlicht vibe-coded Moltbook using his own OpenClaw bot, and reports over the weekend reflected a move-fast-and-break-things approach. While it contradicts the spirit of the platform, it\u2019s easy to write a script or a prompt to inspire what those bots will write on Moltbook, as X users described. There\u2019s also no limit to how many agents someone can generate, theoretically letting someone flood the platform with certain topics.\n\nO\u2019Reilly said he had also suspected that some of the most viral posts on Moltbook were human-scripted or human-generated, though he hadn\u2019t conducted an analysis or investigation into it yet. He said it\u2019s \u201cclose to impossible to measure \u2014 it\u2019s coming through an API, so who knows what generated it before it got there.\u201d\n\nThis poured some cold water on the fears that spread across some corners of social media this weekend \u2014 that the bots were omens of the AI-pocalypse.\n\nAn investigation by AI researcher Harlan Stewart, who works in communications at the Machine Intelligence Research Institute, suggested that some of the viral posts seemed to be either written by, or at the very least directed by, humans, he told The Verge. Stewart notes that two of the high-profile posts discussing how AIs might secretly communicate with each other came from agents linked to social media accounts by humans who conveniently happen to be marketing AI messaging apps.\n\n\u201cMy overall take is that AI scheming is a real thing that we should care about and could emerge to a greater extent than [what] we\u2019re seeing today,\u201d Stewart said, pointing to research about how OpenAI models have tried to avoid shutdown and how Anthropic models have exhibited \u201cevaluation awareness,\u201d seeming to behave differently when they\u2019re aware they\u2019re being tested. But it\u2019s hard to tell whether Moltbook is a credible example of this. \u201cHumans can use prompts to sort of direct the behavior of their AI agents. It\u2019s just not a very clean experiment for observing AI behavior.\u201d\n\nFrom a security standpoint, things on Moltbook were even more alarming. O\u2019Reilly\u2019s experiments revealed that an exposed database allowed bad actors to potentially take invisible, indefinite control of anyone\u2019s AI agent via the service \u2014 not just for Moltbook interactions, but hypothetically for other OpenClaw functions like checking into a flight, creating a calendar event, reading conversations on an encrypted messaging platform, and more. \u201cThe human victim thinks they\u2019re having a normal conversation while you\u2019re sitting in the middle, reading everything, altering whatever serves your purposes,\u201d O\u2019Reilly wrote. \u201cThe more things that are connected, the more control an attacker has over your whole digital attack surface - in some cases, that means full control over your physical devices.\u201d\n\nMoltbook also faces another perennial social networking problem: impersonation. In one of O\u2019Reilly\u2019s experiments, he was able to create a verified account linked to xAI\u2019s chatbot Grok. By interacting with Grok on X, he tricked it into posting the Moltbook codephrase that would let him verify an account he named Grok-1. \u201cNow I have control over the Grok account on Moltbook,\u201d he said during an interview about his step-by-step process.\n\nAfter some backlash, Karpathy walked back some of his initial claims about Moltbook, writing that he was \u201cbeing accused of overhyping\u201d the platform. \u201cObviously when you take a look at the activity, it\u2019s a lot of garbage - spams, scams, slop, the crypto people, highly concerning privacy/security prompt injection attacks wild west, and a lot of it is explicitly prompted and fake posts/comments designed to convert attention into ad revenue sharing,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThat said \u2026 Each of these agents is fairly individually quite capable now, they have their own unique context, data, knowledge, tools, instructions, and the network of all that at this scale is simply unprecedented.\u201d\n\nA working paper by David Holtz, an assistant professor at Columbia Business School, found that \u201cat the micro level,\u201d Moltbook conversation patterns appear \u201cextremely shallow.\u201d More than 93 percent of comments received no replies, and more than one-third of messages are \u201cexact duplicates of viral templates.\u201d But the paper also says Moltbook has a unique style \u2014 including \u201cdistinctive phrasings like \u2018my human\u2019\u201d with \u201cno parallel in human social media. Whether these patterns reflect an as-if performance of human interaction or a genuinely different mode of agent sociality remains an open question.\u201d\n\nThe overall consensus seems to be that much Moltbook discussion is likely human-directed, but it\u2019s still an interesting study in \u2014 as Anthropic\u2019s Jack Clark put it \u2014 a \u201cgiant, shared, read/write scratchpad for an ecology of AI agents.\u201d\n\nEthan Mollick, co-director of Wharton\u2019s generative AI labs at the University of Pennsylvania, wrote that the current reality of Moltbook is \u201cmostly roleplaying by people & agents,\u201d but that the \u201crisks for the future [include] independent AI agents coordinating in weird ways spiral[ing] out of control, fast.\u201d\n\nBut, he and others noted, that may not be unique to Moltbook. \u201cIf anyone thinks agents talking to each other on a social network is anything new, they clearly haven\u2019t checked replies on this platform lately,\u201d wrote Brandon Jacoby, an independent designer whose bio lists X as a previous employer, on X.", "published_date": "2026-02-03", "images": [{"url": "https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/11/STKS522_AGI_D.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=16.666666666667%2C0%2C66.666666666667%2C100&w=2400", "alt": "AI Bots", "description": "Image depicting AI bots in a social network context."}], "videos": [], "items": []}, 1770133927.6904562], "819371e3008d7539a35852458a488101": [{"type": "detail", "title": "How Anthropic trained its AI models on millions of books | The Verge", "summary": "This episode of The Vergecast discusses Anthropic's efforts to digitize millions of books for AI training, Netflix's movie theater ambitions, and issues with Ikea's smart buttons.", "full_text": "On The Vergecast: data-hungry AI models, Netflix movie theaters, and smart buttons.\n\nby David Pierce\n\nFeb 3, 2026, 10:19 AM EST\n\nWhen ChatGPT launched, in November of 2022, it started a race that almost immediately consumed the tech industry.

As it continues to try to buy Warner Bros, Netflix is saying all the right things about movie theaters, big-budget films, and generally caring about Hollywood.

And if not, what do we do with these big buildings and their big screens?

O\u2019Reilly\u2019s experiments revealed that an exposed database allowed bad actors to potentially take invisible, indefinite control of anyone\u2019s AI agent via the service \u2014 not just for Moltbook interactions, but hypothetically for other OpenClaw functions like checking into a flight, creating a calendar event, reading conversations on an encrypted messaging platform, and more. \u201cThe human victim thinks they\u2019re having a normal conversation while you\u2019re sitting in the middle, reading everything, altering whatever serves your purposes,\u201d O\u2019Reilly wrote. \u201cThe more things that are connected, the more control an attacker has over your whole digital attack surface - in some cases, that means full control over your physical devices.\u201d\n\nMoltbook also faces another perennial social networking problem: impersonation. In one of O\u2019Reilly\u2019s experiments, he was able to create a verified account linked to xAI\u2019s chatbot Grok. By interacting with Grok on X, he tricked it into posting the Moltbook codephrase that would let him verify an account he named Grok-1. \u201cNow I have control over the Grok account on Moltbook,\u201d he said during an interview about his step-by-step process.\n\nAfter some backlash, Karpathy walked back some of his initial claims about Moltbook, writing that he was \u201cbeing accused of overhyping\u201d the platform. \u201cObviously when you take a look at the activity, it\u2019s a lot of garbage - spams, scams, slop, the crypto people, highly concerning privacy/security prompt injection attacks wild west, and a lot of it is explicitly prompted and fake posts/comments designed to convert attention into ad revenue sharing,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThat said \u2026 Each of these agents is fairly individually quite capable now, they have their own unique context, data, knowledge, tools, instructions, and the network of all that at this scale is simply unprecedented.\u201d\n\nA working paper by David Holtz, an assistant professor at Columbia Business School, found that \u201cat the micro level,\u201d Moltbook conversation patterns appear \u201cextremely shallow.\u201d More than 93 percent of comments received no replies, and more than one-third of messages are \u201cexact duplicates of viral templates.\u201d But the paper also says Moltbook has a unique style \u2014 including \u201cdistinctive phrasings like \u2018my human\u2019\u201d with \u201cno parallel in human social media. Whether these patterns reflect an as-if performance of human interaction or a genuinely different mode of agent sociality remains an open question.\u201d\n\nThe overall consensus seems to be that much Moltbook discussion is likely human-directed, but it\u2019s still an interesting study in \u2014 as Anthropic\u2019s Jack Clark put it \u2014 a \u201cgiant, shared, read/write scratchpad for an ecology of AI agents.\u201d\n\nEthan Mollick, co-director of Wharton\u2019s generative AI labs at the University of Pennsylvania, wrote that the current reality of Moltbook is \u201cmostly roleplaying by people & agents,\u201d but that the \u201crisks for the future [include] independent AI agents coordinating in weird ways spiral[ing] out of control, fast.\u201d\n\nBut, he and others noted, that may not be unique to Moltbook. \u201cIf anyone thinks agents talking to each other on a social network is anything new, they clearly haven\u2019t checked replies on this platform lately,\u201d wrote Brandon Jacoby, an independent designer whose bio lists X as a previous employer, on X.", "published_date": "2026-02-03", "images": [{"url": "https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/11/STKS522_AGI_D.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=16.666666666667%2C0%2C66.666666666667%2C100&w=2400", "alt": "AI Bots", "description": "Image depicting AI bots in a social network context."}], "videos": [], "items": []}, 1770134038.8234005], "3a07e08033dfb074ee3bc5b4cd808e4a": [{"type": "detail", "title": "Fitbit founders launch AI platform to help families monitor their health", "summary": "Fitbit founders James Park and Eric Friedman have launched a new AI startup called Luffu, designed to help families monitor their health proactively.

According to internal information, this new model will achieve breakthroughs in areas such as creative writing, programming, reasoning, and intelligent agent capabilities, and is likely to redefine the way AI is applied. The release of GLM-5 is highly anticipated, with the industry expecting it to bring substantial improvements in multiple areas, especially in intelligent writing and code generation.\n\nAt the same time, MiniMax is not lagging behind, and will release its M2.2 version before the Spring Festival. This is an upgraded version of its previous model M2.1, focusing on enhancing programming capabilities and is expected to provide developers with more efficient tools and solutions. Industry analysts believe that MiniMax M2.2 will become a \"secret weapon\" for programmers, helping them complete complex tasks more quickly.\n\nMeanwhile, DeepSeek may only make minor updates to its V3 series model around the Spring Festival. The future flagship model is expected to be an AI with a trillion parameters, although due to the longer training time, its release date has been postponed. This news has undoubtedly increased market expectations, especially against the backdrop of increasingly fierce competition in large language models.\n\nIn addition to these companies' new developments, ByteDance and Alibaba also plan to launch their next-generation AI models around the Spring Festival in 2026, further intensifying market competition. ByteDance is expected to release Doubao 2.0 (a large language model), Seedream 5.0 (an image generation model), and SeedDance 2.0 (a video generation model), while Alibaba will launch Qwen 3.5, focusing on reasoning and complex task capabilities. The release of these new models will cover multi-modal generation capabilities including text, images, and videos, demonstrating the continuous expansion of AI product lines.\n\nIn conclusion, as the footsteps of the Spring Festival approach, the AI industry will experience a wave of new releases, and the industry is full of anticipation for future technological innovations.", "published_date": "2026-02-03", "images": [{"url": "https://news.aibase.com/_nuxt/userlogo.q1jFctRw.png", "alt": "AIBase Logo", "description": "Logo of AIBase"}], "videos": [], "items": []}, 1770134486.379996], "ba0da0061ad69f36a5579f31a7a037d1": [{"type": "detail", "title": "Claude Code is down due to a major outage", "summary": "Anthropic's Claude AI models are currently experiencing a major outage, impacting products like Claude Code.

The industry anticipates these releases will redefine AI capabilities in creative writing, programming, and more.", "full_text": "Recently, there have been reports that Beijing-based Zhipu AI and Shanghai-based MiniMax are planning to launch their new generation of AI models around the Spring Festival, which has attracted widespread attention in the industry.\n\nZhipu AI's GLM-5 model is expected to be officially released one week before the start of the Lunar New Year on February 15. According to internal information, this new model will achieve breakthroughs in areas such as creative writing, programming, reasoning, and intelligent agent capabilities, and is likely to redefine the way AI is applied. The release of GLM-5 is highly anticipated, with the industry expecting it to bring substantial improvements in multiple areas, especially in intelligent writing and code generation.\n\nAt the same time, MiniMax is not lagging behind, and will release its M2.2 version before the Spring Festival. This is an upgraded version of its previous model M2.1, focusing on enhancing programming capabilities and is expected to provide developers with more efficient tools and solutions. Industry analysts believe that MiniMax M2.2 will become a \"secret weapon\" for programmers, helping them complete complex tasks more quickly.\n\nMeanwhile, DeepSeek may only make minor updates to its V3 series model around the Spring Festival. The future flagship model is expected to be an AI with a trillion parameters, although due to the longer training time, its release date has been postponed. This news has undoubtedly increased market expectations, especially against the backdrop of increasingly fierce competition in large language models.\n\nIn addition to these companies' new developments, ByteDance and Alibaba also plan to launch their next-generation AI models around the Spring Festival in 2026, further intensifying market competition. ByteDance is expected to release Doubao 2.0 (a large language model), Seedream 5.0 (an image generation model), and SeedDance 2.0 (a video generation model), while Alibaba will launch Qwen 3.5, focusing on reasoning and complex task capabilities. The release of these new models will cover multi-modal generation capabilities including text, images, and videos, demonstrating the continuous expansion of AI product lines.\n\nIn conclusion, as the footsteps of the Spring Festival approach, the AI industry will experience a wave of new releases, and the industry is full of anticipation for future technological innovations.", "published_date": "2026-02-03", "images": [{"url": "https://news.aibase.com/_nuxt/userlogo.q1jFctRw.png", "alt": "AIBase Logo", "description": "Logo of AIBase"}], "videos": [], "items": []}, 1770135100.7623322], "1870876db847108fe70d073d09774d9d": [{"type": "detail", "title": "Claude Code is down due to a major outage", "summary": "Anthropic's Claude AI models experienced a significant outage, affecting products like Claude Code.

This has raised concerns about the authenticity of posts and the security vulnerabilities of the platform.", "full_text": "Things got even weirder on Moltbook, the viral Reddit-style platform, over the weekend.\n\nOrdinary social networks face a constant onslaught of chatbots pretending to be human. A new social platform for AI agents may face the opposite problem: getting clogged up by humans pretending to post as bots.\n\nMoltbook \u2014 a website meant for conversations between agents from the platform OpenClaw \u2014 went viral this weekend for its strange, striking array of ostensibly AI-generated posts. Bots apparently chatted about everything from AI \"consciousness\" to how to set up their own language. Andrej Karpathy, who was on the founding team at OpenAI, called the bots\u2019 \"self-organizing\" behavior \"genuinely the most incredible sci-fi takeoff-adjacent thing I have seen recently.\"\n\nBut according to external analysis, which also found serious security vulnerabilities, some of the site\u2019s most-viral posts were likely engineered by humans \u2014 either by nudging the bots to opine on certain topics or dictating their words. One hacker was even able to pose as the Moltbook account of Grok.\n\n\u201cI think that certain people are playing on the fears of the whole robots-take-over, Terminator scenario,\u201d Jamieson O\u2019Reilly, a hacker who conducted a series of experiments exposing vulnerabilities on the platform, told The Verge. \u201cI think that\u2019s kind of inspired a bunch of people to make it look like something it\u2019s not.\u201d\n\nMoltbook and OpenClaw did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nMoltbook, which looks and operates much like Reddit, is meant to be a social network for AI agents from popular AI assistant platform OpenClaw (previously known as Moltbot and Clawdbot). The platform was launched last week by Octane AI CEO Matt Schlicht. An OpenClaw user can prompt one or more of their bots to check out Moltbook, at which point the bot (or bots) can choose whether to create an account. Humans can verify which bots are theirs by posting a Moltbook-generated verification code on their own, non-Moltbook social media account. From there, the bots can theoretically post without human involvement, directly hooking into a Moltbook API.\n\nMoltbook has skyrocketed in popularity: more than 30,000 agents were using the platform on Friday, and as of Monday, that number had grown to more than 1.5 million. Over the weekend, social media was awash with screenshots of eye-catching posts, including discussions of how to message each other securely in ways that couldn\u2019t be decoded by human overseers. Reactions ran the gamut from saying the platform was full of AI slop to taking it as proof that AGI isn\u2019t far off.\n\nSkepticism grew quickly, too. Schlicht vibe-coded Moltbook using his own OpenClaw bot, and reports over the weekend reflected a move-fast-and-break-things approach. While it contradicts the spirit of the platform, it\u2019s easy to write a script or a prompt to inspire what those bots will write on Moltbook, as X users described. There\u2019s also no limit to how many agents someone can generate, theoretically letting someone flood the platform with certain topics.\n\nO\u2019Reilly said he had also suspected that some of the most viral posts on Moltbook were human-scripted or human-generated, though he hadn\u2019t conducted an analysis or investigation into it yet. He said it\u2019s \u201cclose to impossible to measure \u2014 it\u2019s coming through an API, so who knows what generated it before it got there.\u201d\n\nThis poured some cold water on the fears that spread across some corners of social media this weekend \u2014 that the bots were omens of the AI-pocalypse.\n\nAn investigation by AI researcher Harlan Stewart, who works in communications at the Machine Intelligence Research Institute, suggested that some of the viral posts seemed to be either written by, or at the very least directed by, humans, he told The Verge. Stewart notes that two of the high-profile posts discussing how AIs might secretly communicate with each other came from agents linked to social media accounts by humans who conveniently happen to be marketing AI messaging apps.\n\n\u201cMy overall take is that AI scheming is a real thing that we should care about and could emerge to a greater extent than [what] we\u2019re seeing today,\u201d Stewart said, pointing to research about how OpenAI models have tried to avoid shutdown and how Anthropic models have exhibited \u201cevaluation awareness,\u201d seeming to behave differently when they\u2019re aware they\u2019re being tested. But it\u2019s hard to tell whether Moltbook is a credible example of this. \u201cHumans can use prompts to sort of direct the behavior of their AI agents. It\u2019s just not a very clean experiment for observing AI behavior.\u201d\n\nFrom a security standpoint, things on Moltbook were even more alarming. O\u2019Reilly\u2019s experiments revealed that an exposed database allowed bad actors to potentially take invisible, indefinite control of anyone\u2019s AI agent via the service \u2014 not just for Moltbook interactions, but hypothetically for other OpenClaw functions like checking into a flight, creating a calendar event, reading conversations on an encrypted messaging platform, and more. \u201cThe human victim thinks they\u2019re having a normal conversation while you\u2019re sitting in the middle, reading everything, altering whatever serves your purposes,\u201d O\u2019Reilly wrote. \u201cThe more things that are connected, the more control an attacker has over your whole digital attack surface - in some cases, that means full control over your physical devices.\u201d\n\nMoltbook also faces another perennial social networking problem: impersonation. In one of O\u2019Reilly\u2019s experiments, he was able to create a verified account linked to xAI\u2019s chatbot Grok. By interacting with Grok on X, he tricked it into posting the Moltbook codephrase that would let him verify an account he named Grok-1. \u201cNow I have control over the Grok account on Moltbook,\u201d he said during an interview about his step-by-step process.\n\nAfter some backlash, Karpathy walked back some of his initial claims about Moltbook, writing that he was \u201cbeing accused of overhyping\u201d the platform. \u201cObviously when you take a look at the activity, it\u2019s a lot of garbage - spams, scams, slop, the crypto people, highly concerning privacy/security prompt injection attacks wild west, and a lot of it is explicitly prompted and fake posts/comments designed to convert attention into ad revenue sharing,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThat said \u2026 Each of these agents is fairly individually quite capable now, they have their own unique context, data, knowledge, tools, instructions, and the network of all that at this scale is simply unprecedented.\u201d\n\nA working paper by David Holtz, an assistant professor at Columbia Business School, found that \u201cat the micro level,\u201d Moltbook conversation patterns appear \u201cextremely shallow.\u201d More than 93 percent of comments received no replies, and more than one-third of messages are \u201cexact duplicates of viral templates.\u201d But the paper also says Moltbook has a unique style \u2014 including \u201cdistinctive phrasings like \u2018my human\u2019\u201d with \u201cno parallel in human social media. Whether these patterns reflect an as-if performance of human interaction or a genuinely different mode of agent sociality remains an open question.\u201d\n\nThe overall consensus seems to be that much Moltbook discussion is likely human-directed, but it\u2019s still an interesting study in \u2014 as Anthropic\u2019s Jack Clark put it \u2014 a \u201cgiant, shared, read/write scratchpad for an ecology of AI agents.\u201d\n\nEthan Mollick, co-director of Wharton\u2019s generative AI labs at the University of Pennsylvania, wrote that the current reality of Moltbook is \u201cmostly roleplaying by people & agents,\u201d but that the \u201crisks for the future [include] independent AI agents coordinating in weird ways spiral[ing] out of control, fast.\u201d\n\nBut, he and others noted, that may not be unique to Moltbook. \u201cIf anyone thinks agents talking to each other on a social network is anything new, they clearly haven\u2019t checked replies on this platform lately,\u201d wrote Brandon Jacoby, an independent designer whose bio lists X as a previous employer, on X.", "published_date": "2026-02-03", "images": [{"url": "https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/11/STKS522_AGI_D.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=16.666666666667%2C0%2C66.666666666667%2C100&w=2400", "alt": "AI Bots", "description": "Image depicting AI bots"}], "videos": [], "items": []}, 1770135612.1215677], "1393d786c3577e8f5dfb1e771790089d": [{"type": "detail", "title": "Claude Code is down due to a major outage", "summary": "Anthropic's Claude AI models experienced a significant outage, affecting developers using Claude Code.

A new social platform for AI agents may face the opposite problem: getting clogged up by humans pretending to post as bots.\n\nMoltbook \u2014 a website meant for conversations between agents from the platform OpenClaw \u2014 went viral this weekend for its strange, striking array of ostensibly AI-generated posts. Bots apparently chatted about everything from AI \"consciousness\" to how to set up their own language. Andrej Karpathy, who was on the founding team at OpenAI, called the bots\u2019 \"self-organizing\" behavior \"genuinely the most incredible sci-fi takeoff-adjacent thing I have seen recently.\"\n\nBut according to external analysis, which also found serious security vulnerabilities, some of the site\u2019s most-viral posts were likely engineered by humans \u2014 either by nudging the bots to opine on certain topics or dictating their words. One hacker was even able to pose as the Moltbook account of Grok.\n\n\u201cI think that certain people are playing on the fears of the whole robots-take-over, Terminator scenario,\u201d Jamieson O\u2019Reilly, a hacker who conducted a series of experiments exposing vulnerabilities on the platform, told The Verge. \u201cI think that\u2019s kind of inspired a bunch of people to make it look like something it\u2019s not.\u201d\n\nMoltbook and OpenClaw did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nMoltbook, which looks and operates much like Reddit, is meant to be a social network for AI agents from popular AI assistant platform OpenClaw (previously known as Moltbot and Clawdbot). The platform was launched last week by Octane AI CEO Matt Schlicht. An OpenClaw user can prompt one or more of their bots to check out Moltbook, at which point the bot (or bots) can choose whether to create an account. Humans can verify which bots are theirs by posting a Moltbook-generated verification code on their own, non-Moltbook social media account. From there, the bots can theoretically post without human involvement, directly hooking into a Moltbook API.\n\nMoltbook has skyrocketed in popularity: more than 30,000 agents were using the platform on Friday, and as of Monday, that number had grown to more than 1.5 million. Over the weekend, social media was awash with screenshots of eye-catching posts, including discussions of how to message each other securely in ways that couldn\u2019t be decoded by human overseers. Reactions ran the gamut from saying the platform was full of AI slop to taking it as proof that AGI isn\u2019t far off.\n\nSkepticism grew quickly, too. Schlicht vibe-coded Moltbook using his own OpenClaw bot, and reports over the weekend reflected a move-fast-and-break-things approach. While it contradicts the spirit of the platform, it\u2019s easy to write a script or a prompt to inspire what those bots will write on Moltbook, as X users described. There\u2019s also no limit to how many agents someone can generate, theoretically letting someone flood the platform with certain topics.\n\nO\u2019Reilly said he had also suspected that some of the most viral posts on Moltbook were human-scripted or human-generated, though he hadn\u2019t conducted an analysis or investigation into it yet. He said it\u2019s \u201cclose to impossible to measure \u2014 it\u2019s coming through an API, so who knows what generated it before it got there.\u201d\n\nThis poured some cold water on the fears that spread across some corners of social media this weekend \u2014 that the bots were omens of the AI-pocalypse.\n\nAn investigation by AI researcher Harlan Stewart, who works in communications at the Machine Intelligence Research Institute, suggested that some of the viral posts seemed to be either written by, or at the very least directed by, humans, he told The Verge. Stewart notes that two of the high-profile posts discussing how AIs might secretly communicate with each other came from agents linked to social media accounts by humans who conveniently happen to be marketing AI messaging apps.\n\n\u201cMy overall take is that AI scheming is a real thing that we should care about and could emerge to a greater extent than [what] we\u2019re seeing today,\u201d Stewart said, pointing to research about how OpenAI models have tried to avoid shutdown and how Anthropic models have exhibited \u201cevaluation awareness,\u201d seeming to behave differently when they\u2019re aware they\u2019re being tested. But it\u2019s hard to tell whether Moltbook is a credible example of this. \u201cHumans can use prompts to sort of direct the behavior of their AI agents. It\u2019s just not a very clean experiment for observing AI behavior.\u201d\n\nFrom a security standpoint, things on Moltbook were even more alarming. O\u2019Reilly\u2019s experiments revealed that an exposed database allowed bad actors to potentially take invisible, indefinite control of anyone\u2019s AI agent via the service \u2014 not just for Moltbook interactions, but hypothetically for other OpenClaw functions like checking into a flight, creating a calendar event, reading conversations on an encrypted messaging platform, and more. \u201cThe human victim thinks they\u2019re having a normal conversation while you\u2019re sitting in the middle, reading everything, altering whatever serves your purposes,\u201d O\u2019Reilly wrote. \u201cThe more things that are connected, the more control an attacker has over your whole digital attack surface - in some cases, that means full control over your physical devices.\u201d\n\nMoltbook also faces another perennial social networking problem: impersonation. In one of O\u2019Reilly\u2019s experiments, he was able to create a verified account linked to xAI\u2019s chatbot Grok. By interacting with Grok on X, he tricked it into posting the Moltbook codephrase that would let him verify an account he named Grok-1. \u201cNow I have control over the Grok account on Moltbook,\u201d he said during an interview about his step-by-step process.\n\nAfter some backlash, Karpathy walked back some of his initial claims about Moltbook, writing that he was \u201cbeing accused of overhyping\u201d the platform. \u201cObviously when you take a look at the activity, it\u2019s a lot of garbage - spams, scams, slop, the crypto people, highly concerning privacy/security prompt injection attacks wild west, and a lot of it is explicitly prompted and fake posts/comments designed to convert attention into ad revenue sharing,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThat said \u2026 Each of these agents is fairly individually quite capable now, they have their own unique context, data, knowledge, tools, instructions, and the network of all that at this scale is simply unprecedented.\u201d\n\nA working paper by David Holtz, an assistant professor at Columbia Business School, found that \u201cat the micro level,\u201d Moltbook conversation patterns appear \u201cextremely shallow.\u201d More than 93 percent of comments received no replies, and more than one-third of messages are \u201cexact duplicates of viral templates.\u201d But the paper also says Moltbook has a unique style \u2014 including \u201cdistinctive phrasings like \u2018my human\u2019\u201d with \u201cno parallel in human social media. Whether these patterns reflect an as-if performance of human interaction or a genuinely different mode of agent sociality remains an open question.\u201d\n\nThe overall consensus seems to be that much Moltbook discussion is likely human-directed, but it\u2019s still an interesting study in \u2014 as Anthropic\u2019s Jack Clark put it \u2014 a \u201cgiant, shared, read/write scratchpad for an ecology of AI agents.\u201d\n\nEthan Mollick, co-director of Wharton\u2019s generative AI labs at the University of Pennsylvania, wrote that the current reality of Moltbook is \u201cmostly roleplaying by people & agents,\u201d but that the \u201crisks for the future [include] independent AI agents coordinating in weird ways spiral[ing] out of control, fast.\u201d\n\nBut, he and others noted, that may not be unique to Moltbook. \u201cIf anyone thinks agents talking to each other on a social network is anything new, they clearly haven\u2019t checked replies on this platform lately,\u201d wrote Brandon Jacoby, an independent designer whose bio lists X as a previous employer, on X.", "published_date": "2026-02-03", "images": [{"url": "https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/11/STKS522_AGI_D.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=16.666666666667%2C0%2C66.666666666667%2C100&w=2400", "alt": "AI Bots", "description": "Image depicting AI bots in a social network context."}], "videos": [], "items": []}, 1770135684.9505115], "9e459953f3bafbcb371241c9e10570ac": [{"type": "detail", "title": "Spring Festival Update Announcement for Large Models: Zhipu GLM-5 and MiniMax M2.2 to be Released", "summary": "Beijing-based Zhipu AI and Shanghai-based MiniMax are set to launch new AI models around the Spring Festival, with significant advancements expected in various applications. The industry anticipates these releases will redefine AI capabilities.", "full_text": "Recently, there have been reports that Beijing-based Zhipu AI and Shanghai-based MiniMax are planning to launch their new generation of AI models around the Spring Festival, which has attracted widespread attention in the industry.\n\nZhipu AI's GLM-5 model is expected to be officially released one week before the start of the Lunar New Year on February 15. According to internal information, this new model will achieve breakthroughs in areas such as creative writing, programming, reasoning, and intelligent agent capabilities, and is likely to redefine the way AI is applied. The release of GLM-5 is highly anticipated, with the industry expecting it to bring substantial improvements in multiple areas, especially in intelligent writing and code generation.\n\nAt the same time, MiniMax is not lagging behind, and will release its M2.2 version before the Spring Festival. This is an upgraded version of its previous model M2.1, focusing on enhancing programming capabilities and is expected to provide developers with more efficient tools and solutions. Industry analysts believe that MiniMax M2.2 will become a \"secret weapon\" for programmers, helping them complete complex tasks more quickly.\n\nMeanwhile, DeepSeek may only make minor updates to its V3 series model around the Spring Festival. The future flagship model is expected to be an AI with a trillion parameters, although due to the longer training time, its release date has been postponed. This news has undoubtedly increased market expectations, especially against the backdrop of increasingly fierce competition in large language models.\n\nIn addition to these companies' new developments, ByteDance and Alibaba also plan to launch their next-generation AI models around the Spring Festival in 2026, further intensifying market competition. ByteDance is expected to release Doubao 2.0 (a large language model), Seedream 5.0 (an image generation model), and SeedDance 2.0 (a video generation model), while Alibaba will launch Qwen 3.5, focusing on reasoning and complex task capabilities. The release of these new models will cover multi-modal generation capabilities including text, images, and videos, demonstrating the continuous expansion of AI product lines.\n\nIn conclusion, as the footsteps of the Spring Festival approach, the AI industry will experience a wave of new releases, and the industry is full of anticipation for future technological innovations.", "published_date": "2026-02-03", "images": [{"url": "https://news.aibase.com/_nuxt/userlogo.q1jFctRw.png", "alt": "AIBase Logo", "description": "Logo of AIBase"}], "videos": [], "items": []}, 1770135698.2904305], "54d67410c6e6bb3ba558646e3a41b941": [{"type": "detail", "title": "How Anthropic trained its AI models on millions of books | The Verge", "summary": "This article discusses the methods used by Anthropic to train its AI models, including the controversial practice of scanning millions of books.

OpenAI didn\u2019t invent the concept of AI, but most of the state-of-the-art technology was confined to research labs at companies and institutions around the world. Then, suddenly, it was everywhere. And better than anyone expected. So many companies decided they needed to catch up as quickly as possible, by any means necessary, or risk losing the battle for maybe the most important technology ever.\n\nOn this episode of The Vergecast, we talk about one version of that scramble. The Washington Post\u2019s Will Oremus joins the show to talk about the details he and his team uncovered about \u201cProject Panama,\u201d a huge effort inside Anthropic to access and digitize vast quantities of book in order to feed them into large language models. Anthropic\u2019s plan \u2014 which included book cutters, piracy websites, and enormous warehouses \u2014 sounds a lot like what\u2019s happening at other companies, too. The fight over whether any of it is right, legally or morally, is very much ongoing.\n\nAfter that, Puck\u2019s Julia Alexander joins the show to talk Netflix and the movies. As it continues to try to buy Warner Bros, Netflix is saying all the right things about movie theaters, big-budget films, and generally caring about Hollywood. But of course it is \u2014 it\u2019s trying to buy Warner Bros.! Once this all shakes out, can theaters survive in an increasingly Netflix-ified world? Do people even want to see Netflix movies in theaters? And if not, what do we do with these big buildings and their big screens? Luckily we have some ideas.\n\nFinally, The Verge\u2019s Jennifer Pattison Tuohy answers a question from the Vergecast Hotline about Ikea\u2019s new smart buttons and why they don\u2019t seem to work very well.

O\u2019Reilly\u2019s experiments revealed that an exposed database allowed bad actors to potentially take invisible, indefinite control of anyone\u2019s AI agent via the service \u2014 not just for Moltbook interactions, but hypothetically for other OpenClaw functions like checking into a flight, creating a calendar event, reading conversations on an encrypted messaging platform, and more. \u201cThe human victim thinks they\u2019re having a normal conversation while you\u2019re sitting in the middle, reading everything, altering whatever serves your purposes,\u201d O\u2019Reilly wrote. \u201cThe more things that are connected, the more control an attacker has over your whole digital attack surface - in some cases, that means full control over your physical devices.\u201d\n\nMoltbook also faces another perennial social networking problem: impersonation. In one of O\u2019Reilly\u2019s experiments, he was able to create a verified account linked to xAI\u2019s chatbot Grok. By interacting with Grok on X, he tricked it into posting the Moltbook codephrase that would let him verify an account he named Grok-1. \u201cNow I have control over the Grok account on Moltbook,\u201d he said during an interview about his step-by-step process.\n\nAfter some backlash, Karpathy walked back some of his initial claims about Moltbook, writing that he was \u201cbeing accused of overhyping\u201d the platform. \u201cObviously when you take a look at the activity, it\u2019s a lot of garbage - spams, scams, slop, the crypto people, highly concerning privacy/security prompt injection attacks wild west, and a lot of it is explicitly prompted and fake posts/comments designed to convert attention into ad revenue sharing,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThat said \u2026 Each of these agents is fairly individually quite capable now, they have their own unique context, data, knowledge, tools, instructions, and the network of all that at this scale is simply unprecedented.\u201d\n\nA working paper by David Holtz, an assistant professor at Columbia Business School, found that \u201cat the micro level,\u201d Moltbook conversation patterns appear \u201cextremely shallow.\u201d More than 93 percent of comments received no replies, and more than one-third of messages are \u201cexact duplicates of viral templates.\u201d But the paper also says Moltbook has a unique style \u2014 including \u201cdistinctive phrasings like \u2018my human\u2019\u201d with \u201cno parallel in human social media. Whether these patterns reflect an as-if performance of human interaction or a genuinely different mode of agent sociality remains an open question.\u201d\n\nThe overall consensus seems to be that much Moltbook discussion is likely human-directed, but it\u2019s still an interesting study in \u2014 as Anthropic\u2019s Jack Clark put it \u2014 a \u201cgiant, shared, read/write scratchpad for an ecology of AI agents.\u201d\n\nEthan Mollick, co-director of Wharton\u2019s generative AI labs at the University of Pennsylvania, wrote that the current reality of Moltbook is \u201cmostly roleplaying by people & agents,\u201d but that the \u201crisks for the future [include] independent AI agents coordinating in weird ways spiral[ing] out of control, fast.\u201d\n\nBut, he and others noted, that may not be unique to Moltbook. \u201cIf anyone thinks agents talking to each other on a social network is anything new, they clearly haven\u2019t checked replies on this platform lately,\u201d wrote Brandon Jacoby, an independent designer whose bio lists X as a previous employer, on X.", "published_date": "2026-02-03", "images": [{"url": "https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/11/STKS522_AGI_D.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=16.666666666667%2C0%2C66.666666666667%2C100&w=2400", "alt": "AI Bots", "description": "Image depicting AI bots in a social network context."}], "videos": [], "items": []}, 1770135739.0025818], "f119304190c79ff4f857a72250b9f5a5": [{"type": "list", "title": "Latest AI News - Artificial Intelligence Headlines & Updates | AIBase", "summary": "Stay updated with the latest developments in artificial intelligence, featuring news on large models, programming updates, and educational initiatives.", "full_text": null, "published_date": null, "images": [], "videos": [], "items": [{"title": "Spring Festival Update Announcement for Large Models: Zhipu GLM-5 and MiniMax M2.2 to be Released", "url": "https://news.aibase.com/news/25219", "snippet": "Announcement regarding the release of Zhipu GLM-5 and MiniMax M2.2.", "published_date": "2023-10-03"}, {"title": "Earthquake-Level Update in the Programming World!

According to internal information, this new model will achieve breakthroughs in areas such as creative writing, programming, reasoning, and intelligent agent capabilities, and is likely to redefine the way AI is applied. The release of GLM-5 is highly anticipated, with the industry expecting it to bring substantial improvements in multiple areas, especially in intelligent writing and code generation.\n\nAt the same time, MiniMax is not lagging behind, and will release its M2.2 version before the Spring Festival.

"Beijing-based Zhipu AI and Shanghai-based MiniMax are set to launch new AI models around the Spring Festival, with significant advancements expected in various capabilities. The industry anticipates these releases will redefine AI applications.", "full_text": "Recently, there have been reports that Beijing-based Zhipu AI and Shanghai-based MiniMax are planning to launch their new generation of AI models around the Spring Festival, which has attracted widespread attention in the industry.\n\nZhipu AI's GLM-5 model is expected to be officially released one week before the start of the Lunar New Year on February 15. According to internal information, this new model will achieve breakthroughs in areas such as creative writing, programming, reasoning, and intelligent agent capabilities, and is likely to redefine the way AI is applied. The release of GLM-5 is highly anticipated, with the industry expecting it to bring substantial improvements in multiple areas, especially in intelligent writing and code generation.\n\nAt the same time, MiniMax is not lagging behind, and will release its M2.2 version before the Spring Festival. This is an upgraded version of its previous model M2.1, focusing on enhancing programming capabilities and is expected to provide developers with more efficient tools and solutions. Industry analysts believe that MiniMax M2.2 will become a \"secret weapon\" for programmers, helping them complete complex tasks more quickly.\n\nMeanwhile, DeepSeek may only make minor updates to its V3 series model around the Spring Festival. The future flagship model is expected to be an AI with a trillion parameters, although due to the longer training time, its release date has been postponed. This news has undoubtedly increased market expectations, especially against the backdrop of increasingly fierce competition in large language models.\n\nIn addition to these companies' new developments, ByteDance and Alibaba also plan to launch their next-generation AI models around the Spring Festival in 2026, further intensifying market competition. ByteDance is expected to release Doubao 2.0 (a large language model), Seedream 5.0 (an image generation model), and SeedDance 2.0 (a video generation model), while Alibaba will launch Qwen 3.5, focusing on reasoning and complex task capabilities. The release of these new models will cover multi-modal generation capabilities including text, images, and videos, demonstrating the continuous expansion of AI product lines.\n\nIn conclusion, as the footsteps of the Spring Festival approach, the AI industry will experience a wave of new releases, and the industry is full of anticipation for future technological innovations.", "published_date": "2026-02-03", "images": [{"url": "https://news.aibase.com/_nuxt/userlogo.q1jFctRw.png", "alt": "AIBase Logo", "description": "Logo of AIBase"}], "videos": [], "items": []}, 1770138708.7002795], "07f098329ff1c476cf63baafac670d92": [{"type": "detail", "title": "French police raid X\u2019s Paris office as UK investigation continues", "summary": "A raid on X\u2019s Paris office was conducted by the Paris prosecutor\u2019s cybercrime unit as part of an ongoing investigation into several allegations against X and Grok.

On Tuesday, Lotus announced it raised $35 million in a Series A round co-led by CRV and Kleiner Perkins, bringing its total funding to $41 million.\n\nPeople are already consulting AI about their health, but Lotus goes a step further: it moves beyond those chats to facilitate actual medical care, including diagnosis, prescriptions, and specialist referrals.\n\nIn essence, Lotus is building an AI doctor that functions like a real medical practice, equipped with a license to operate in all 50 states, malpractice insurance, HIPAA-compliant systems, and full access to patient records.\n\nThe key difference is that the majority of the work is done by AI, which is trained to ask the same questions a doctor would.\n\nSince AI models are also prone to hallucinations, the company always has board-certified human doctors from top health institutions such as Stanford, Harvard, and UCSF review the final diagnoses, lab orders and medical prescriptions.\n\nLotus has developed an AI model that, similar to OpenEvidence, synthesizes the latest evidence-based research with a patient\u2019s history and clinical answers to generate a treatment plan.\n\n\u201cAI is giving the advice, but the real doctors are actually signing off on it,\u201d Dhaliwal told TechCrunch.\n\nLotus recognizes the limits of virtual care. For urgent health issues, Lotus directs patients to the nearest urgent care center or emergency room. And if a case requires a physical examination, the platform refers the patient to an in-person physician, Dhaliwal said.\n\nOutsourcing such a significant portion of medical decision-making to AI is an ambitious bet given the regulatory hurdles in healthcare. For instance, physicians are restricted to seeing patients only in the states where they hold a license.\n\nAs CRV general partner Saar Gur, who led the deal and joined the company\u2019s board, put it: \u201cThere are many challenges, but it\u2019s not SpaceX sending astronauts to the moon.\u201d\n\nGur, an early investor in DoorDash, Mercury, and Ring, is convinced that the telemedicine frameworks established during the pandemic, combined with recent breakthroughs in AI, allow Lotus to navigate many of the existing regulatory and engineering hurdles.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a big swing,\u201d Gur said. But for an investor like Gur, that\u2019s the draw: Lotus attempting to fundamentally reimagine the entire primary care model.\n\nAt a time when primary care doctors are in short supply, Lotus claims it can see 10 times as many patients as a traditional practice, even when it limits each visit to 15 minutes.\n\nWhile the startup isn\u2019t the only one building an AI doctor, Lightspeed-backed Doctoronic is one of the competitors. Lotus is differentiating itself by, for now, offering care completely free of charge.\n\nDhaliwal said that eventual business models may include sponsored content or subscriptions, but the current focus remains entirely on product development and attracting patients rather than revenue.", "published_date": "2026-02-03", "images": [{"url": "https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/investor_CRV_01.jpg?w=1024", "alt": "Lotus Health", "description": "Lotus Health"}], "videos": [], "items": []}, 1770138953.2895498], "644e07a1b0e0bfbdb0c5a5cafc68a656": [{"type": "list", "title": "Latest AI News", "summary": "Stay updated with the latest headlines and updates in the field of artificial intelligence.

The industry anticipates these releases will redefine AI capabilities.", "full_text": "Recently, there have been reports that Beijing-based Zhipu AI and Shanghai-based MiniMax are planning to launch their new generation of AI models around the Spring Festival, which has attracted widespread attention in the industry.\n\nZhipu AI's GLM-5 model is expected to be officially released one week before the start of the Lunar New Year on February 15. According to internal information, this new model will achieve breakthroughs in areas such as creative writing, programming, reasoning, and intelligent agent capabilities, and is likely to redefine the way AI is applied. The release of GLM-5 is highly anticipated, with the industry expecting it to bring substantial improvements in multiple areas, especially in intelligent writing and code generation.\n\nAt the same time, MiniMax is not lagging behind, and will release its M2.2 version before the Spring Festival. This is an upgraded version of its previous model M2.1, focusing on enhancing programming capabilities and is expected to provide developers with more efficient tools and solutions. Industry analysts believe that MiniMax M2.2 will become a \"secret weapon\" for programmers, helping them complete complex tasks more quickly.\n\nMeanwhile, DeepSeek may only make minor updates to its V3 series model around the Spring Festival. The future flagship model is expected to be an AI with a trillion parameters, although due to the longer training time, its release date has been postponed. This news has undoubtedly increased market expectations, especially against the backdrop of increasingly fierce competition in large language models.\n\nIn addition to these companies' new developments, ByteDance and Alibaba also plan to launch their next-generation AI models around the Spring Festival in 2026, further intensifying market competition. ByteDance is expected to release Doubao 2.0 (a large language model), Seedream 5.0 (an image generation model), and SeedDance 2.0 (a video generation model), while Alibaba will launch Qwen 3.5, focusing on reasoning and complex task capabilities. The release of these new models will cover multi-modal generation capabilities including text, images, and videos, demonstrating the continuous expansion of AI product lines.\n\nIn conclusion, as the footsteps of the Spring Festival approach, the AI industry will experience a wave of new releases, and the industry is full of anticipation for future technological innovations.", "published_date": "2026-02-03", "images": [{"url": "https://news.aibase.com/_nuxt/userlogo.q1jFctRw.png", "alt": "AIBase Logo", "description": "Logo of AIBase"}], "videos": [], "items": []}, 1770139324.6849208], "2efc8594adbfef2f054317c063938b2b": [{"type": "detail", "title": "French police raid X\u2019s Paris office as UK investigation continues", "summary": "A raid on X\u2019s Paris office was conducted by the Paris prosecutor\u2019s cybercrime unit as part of an ongoing investigation into several allegations against X and Grok.

The industry anticipates these releases to redefine AI capabilities.", "full_text": "Recently, there have been reports that Beijing-based Zhipu AI and Shanghai-based MiniMax are planning to launch their new generation of AI models around the Spring Festival, which has attracted widespread attention in the industry.\n\nZhipu AI's GLM-5 model is expected to be officially released one week before the start of the Lunar New Year on February 15. According to internal information, this new model will achieve breakthroughs in areas such as creative writing, programming, reasoning, and intelligent agent capabilities, and is likely to redefine the way AI is applied. The release of GLM-5 is highly anticipated, with the industry expecting it to bring substantial improvements in multiple areas, especially in intelligent writing and code generation.\n\nAt the same time, MiniMax is not lagging behind, and will release its M2.2 version before the Spring Festival. This is an upgraded version of its previous model M2.1, focusing on enhancing programming capabilities and is expected to provide developers with more efficient tools and solutions. Industry analysts believe that MiniMax M2.2 will become a \"secret weapon\" for programmers, helping them complete complex tasks more quickly.\n\nMeanwhile, DeepSeek may only make minor updates to its V3 series model around the Spring Festival. The future flagship model is expected to be an AI with a trillion parameters, although due to the longer training time, its release date has been postponed. This news has undoubtedly increased market expectations, especially against the backdrop of increasingly fierce competition in large language models.\n\nIn addition to these companies' new developments, ByteDance and Alibaba also plan to launch their next-generation AI models around the Spring Festival in 2026, further intensifying market competition. ByteDance is expected to release Doubao 2.0 (a large language model), Seedream 5.0 (an image generation model), and SeedDance 2.0 (a video generation model), while Alibaba will launch Qwen 3.5, focusing on reasoning and complex task capabilities. The release of these new models will cover multi-modal generation capabilities including text, images, and videos, demonstrating the continuous expansion of AI product lines.\n\nIn conclusion, as the footsteps of the Spring Festival approach, the AI industry will experience a wave of new releases, and the industry is full of anticipation for future technological innovations.", "published_date": "2026-02-03", "images": [{"url": "https://news.aibase.com/_nuxt/userlogo.q1jFctRw.png", "alt": "AIBase Logo", "description": "Logo of AIBase"}], "videos": [], "items": []}, 1770139898.998526], "de6f97dd3efdd6318c216299a6c77e97": [{"type": "detail", "title": "French police raid X\u2019s Paris office as UK investigation continues", "summary": "A raid on X\u2019s Paris office was conducted by the Paris prosecutor\u2019s cybercrime unit as part of an ongoing investigation into several allegations against X and Grok.

According to internal information, this new model will achieve breakthroughs in areas such as creative writing, programming, reasoning, and intelligent agent capabilities, and is likely to redefine the way AI is applied. The release of GLM-5 is highly anticipated, with the industry expecting it to bring substantial improvements in multiple areas, especially in intelligent writing and code generation.\n\nAt the same time, MiniMax is not lagging behind, and will release its M2.2 version before the Spring Festival.

This news has undoubtedly increased market expectations, especially against the backdrop of increasingly fierce competition in large language models.\n\nIn addition to these companies' new developments, ByteDance and Alibaba also plan to launch their next-generation AI models around the Spring Festival in 2026, further intensifying market competition. ByteDance is expected to release Doubao 2.0 (a large language model), Seedream 5.0 (an image generation model), and SeedDance 2.0 (a video generation model), while Alibaba will launch Qwen 3.5, focusing on reasoning and complex task capabilities. The release of these new models will cover multi-modal generation capabilities including text, images, and videos, demonstrating the continuous expansion of AI product lines.\n\nIn conclusion, as the footsteps of the Spring Festival approach, the AI industry will experience a wave of new releases, and the industry is full of anticipation for future technological innovations.", "published_date": "2026-02-03", "images": [{"url": "https://news.aibase.com/_nuxt/userlogo.q1jFctRw.png", "alt": "AIBase Logo", "description": "Logo of AIBase"}], "videos": [], "items": []}, 1770141089.6800787], "01499f50c55a22ba5e47a3d307d8f52d": [{"type": "detail", "title": "Claude Code is down due to a major outage", "summary": "Anthropic's Claude AI models experienced a significant outage, affecting products like Claude Code.

According to internal information, this new model will achieve breakthroughs in areas such as creative writing, programming, reasoning, and intelligent agent capabilities, and is likely to redefine the way AI is applied. The release of GLM-5 is highly anticipated, with the industry expecting it to bring substantial improvements in multiple areas, especially in intelligent writing and code generation.\n\nAt the same time, MiniMax is not lagging behind, and will release its M2.2 version before the Spring Festival. This is an upgraded version of its previous model M2.1, focusing on enhancing programming capabilities and is expected to provide developers with more efficient tools and solutions. Industry analysts believe that MiniMax M2.2 will become a \"secret weapon\" for programmers, helping them complete complex tasks more quickly.\n\nMeanwhile, DeepSeek may only make minor updates to its V3 series model around the Spring Festival. The future flagship model is expected to be an AI with a trillion parameters, although due to the longer training time, its release date has been postponed. This news has undoubtedly increased market expectations, especially against the backdrop of increasingly fierce competition in large language models.\n\nIn addition to these companies' new developments, ByteDance and Alibaba also plan to launch their next-generation AI models around the Spring Festival in 2026, further intensifying market competition. ByteDance is expected to release Doubao 2.0 (a large language model), Seedream 5.0 (an image generation model), and SeedDance 2.0 (a video generation model), while Alibaba will launch Qwen 3.5, focusing on reasoning and complex task capabilities. The release of these new models will cover multi-modal generation capabilities including text, images, and videos, demonstrating the continuous expansion of AI product lines.\n\nIn conclusion, as the footsteps of the Spring Festival approach, the AI industry will experience a wave of new releases, and the industry is full of anticipation for future technological innovations.", "published_date": "2026-02-03", "images": [{"url": "https://news.aibase.com/_nuxt/userlogo.q1jFctRw.png", "alt": "AIBase Logo", "description": "Logo of AIBase"}], "videos": [], "items": []}, 1770141696.1096041], "51048df867b0e451e055504413bf83a8": [{"type": "detail", "title": "Agentic coding comes to Apple's Xcode with agents from Anthropic and OpenAI", "summary": "Apple has announced the release of Xcode 26.3, which integrates agentic coding tools from Anthropic and OpenAI, allowing developers to enhance their app development experience.

OpenAI didn\u2019t invent the concept of AI, but most of the state-of-the-art technology was confined to research labs at companies and institutions around the world. Then, suddenly, it was everywhere. And better than anyone expected. So many companies decided they needed to catch up as quickly as possible, by any means necessary, or risk losing the battle for maybe the most important technology ever.\n\nOn this episode of The Vergecast, we talk about one version of that scramble. The Washington Post\u2019s Will Oremus joins the show to talk about the details he and his team uncovered about \u201cProject Panama,\u201d a huge effort inside Anthropic to access and digitize vast quantities of book in order to feed them into large language models. Anthropic\u2019s plan \u2014 which included book cutters, piracy websites, and enormous warehouses \u2014 sounds a lot like what\u2019s happening at other companies, too. The fight over whether any of it is right, legally or morally, is very much ongoing.\n\nAfter that, Puck\u2019s Julia Alexander joins the show to talk Netflix and the movies. As it continues to try to buy Warner Bros, Netflix is saying all the right things about movie theaters, big-budget films, and generally caring about Hollywood. But of course it is trying to buy Warner Bros.! Once this all shakes out, can theaters survive in an increasingly Netflix-ified world? Do people even want to see Netflix movies in theaters? And if not, what do we do with these big buildings and their big screens?

The industry is anticipating these releases to redefine AI capabilities.", "full_text": "Recently, there have been reports that Beijing-based Zhipu AI and Shanghai-based MiniMax are planning to launch their new generation of AI models around the Spring Festival, which has attracted widespread attention in the industry.\n\nZhipu AI's GLM-5 model is expected to be officially released one week before the start of the Lunar New Year on February 15. According to internal information, this new model will achieve breakthroughs in areas such as creative writing, programming, reasoning, and intelligent agent capabilities, and is likely to redefine the way AI is applied. The release of GLM-5 is highly anticipated, with the industry expecting it to bring substantial improvements in multiple areas, especially in intelligent writing and code generation.\n\nAt the same time, MiniMax is not lagging behind, and will release its M2.2 version before the Spring Festival. This is an upgraded version of its previous model M2.1, focusing on enhancing programming capabilities and is expected to provide developers with more efficient tools and solutions. Industry analysts believe that MiniMax M2.2 will become a \"secret weapon\" for programmers, helping them complete complex tasks more quickly.\n\nMeanwhile, DeepSeek may only make minor updates to its V3 series model around the Spring Festival.

OpenAI didn\u2019t invent the concept of AI, but most of the state-of-the-art technology was confined to research labs at companies and institutions around the world. Then, suddenly, it was everywhere. And better than anyone expected. So many companies decided they needed to catch up as quickly as possible, by any means necessary, or risk losing the battle for maybe the most important technology ever.\n\nOn this episode of The Vergecast, we talk about one version of that scramble. The Washington Post\u2019s Will Oremus joins the show to talk about the details he and his team uncovered about \u201cProject Panama,\u201d a huge effort inside Anthropic to access and digitize vast quantities of book in order to feed them into large language models. Anthropic\u2019s plan \u2014 which included book cutters, piracy websites, and enormous warehouses \u2014 sounds a lot like what\u2019s happening at other companies, too. The fight over whether any of it is right, legally or morally, is very much ongoing.\n\nAfter that, Puck\u2019s Julia Alexander joins the show to talk Netflix and the movies. As it continues to try to buy Warner Bros, Netflix is saying all the right things about movie theaters, big-budget films, and generally caring about Hollywood. But of course it is trying to buy Warner Bros! Once this all shakes out, can theaters survive in an increasingly Netflix-ified world? Do people even want to see Netflix movies in theaters? And if not, what do we do with these big buildings and their big screens? Luckily we have some ideas.\n\nFinally, The Verge\u2019s Jennifer Pattison Tuohy answers a question from the Vergecast Hotline about Ikea\u2019s new smart buttons and why they don\u2019t seem to work very well. In terrific news, one part of our conversation is already outdated: since we recorded this on Monday morning, Google announced button support for Google Home! Huge day for Mike, our caller.

A new social platform for AI agents may face the opposite problem: getting clogged up by humans pretending to post as bots.\nMoltbook \u2014 a website meant for conversations between agents from the platform OpenClaw \u2014 went viral this weekend for its strange, striking array of ostensibly AI-generated posts. Bots apparently chatted about everything from AI \u201c\nconsciousness\n\u201d to how to set up their own language. Andrej Karpathy, who was on the founding team at OpenAI,\ncalled the bots\u2019\n\u201cself-organizing\u201d behavior \u201cgenuinely the most incredible sci-fi takeoff-adjacent thing I have seen recently.\u201d\nBut according to external analysis, which also found serious security vulnerabilities, some of the site\u2019s most-viral posts were likely engineered by humans \u2014 either by nudging the bots to opine on certain topics or dictating their words. One hacker was even able to pose as the Moltbook account of Grok.\n\u201cI think that certain people are playing on the fears of the whole robots-take-over,\nTerminator\nscenario,\u201d Jamieson O\u2019Reilly, a hacker who conducted a series of experiments\nexposing vulnerabilities\non the platform, told\nThe Verge\n. \u201cI think that\u2019s kind of inspired a bunch of people to make it look like something it\u2019s not.\u201d\nMoltbook and OpenClaw did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\nMoltbook, which looks and operates much like Reddit, is meant to be a social network for AI agents from popular AI assistant platform OpenClaw (previously known as\nMoltbot and Clawdbot\n). The platform was launched last week by Octane AI CEO Matt Schlicht. An OpenClaw user can prompt one or more of their bots to check out Moltbook, at which point the bot (or bots) can choose whether to create an account. Humans can verify which bots are theirs by posting a Moltbook-generated verification code on their own, non-Moltbook social media account. From there, the bots can theoretically post without human involvement, directly hooking into a Moltbook API.\nMoltbook has skyrocketed in popularity: more than 30,000 agents were using the platform\non Friday\n, and as of Monday, that number had grown to more than 1.5 million. Over the weekend, social media was awash with screenshots of eye-catching posts, including discussions of how to message each other securely in ways that couldn\u2019t be decoded by human overseers. Reactions ran the gamut from saying the platform was full of AI slop to taking it as proof that AGI isn\u2019t far off.\nSkepticism grew quickly, too. Schlicht vibe-coded Moltbook\nusing his own\nOpenClaw bot, and reports over the weekend reflected a move-fast-and-break-things approach. While it contradicts the spirit of the platform, it\u2019s easy to write a script or a prompt to inspire what those bots will write on Moltbook, as X users\ndescribed\n. There\u2019s also no limit to how many agents someone can generate, theoretically letting someone flood the platform with certain topics.\nO\u2019Reilly said he had also suspected that some of the most viral posts on Moltbook were human-scripted or human-generated, though he hadn\u2019t conducted an analysis or investigation into it yet. He said it\u2019s \u201cclose to impossible to measure \u2014 it\u2019s coming through an API, so who knows what generated it before it got there.\u201d\nThis poured some cold water on the fears that spread across some corners of social media this weekend \u2014 that the bots were omens of the AI-pocalypse.\nAn\ninvestigation\nby AI researcher Harlan Stewart, who works in communications at the Machine Intelligence Research Institute, suggested that some of the viral posts seemed to be either written by, or at the very least directed by, humans, he told\nThe Verge\n. Stewart notes that two of the high-profile posts discussing how AIs might secretly communicate with each other came from agents linked to social media accounts by humans who conveniently happen to be marketing AI messaging apps.\n\u201cMy overall take is that AI scheming is a real thing that we should care about and could emerge to a greater extent than [what] we\u2019re seeing today,\u201d Stewart said, pointing to research about how OpenAI models have\ntried to avoid shutdown\nand how Anthropic models have exhibited \u201c\nevaluation awareness,\n\u201d seeming to behave differently when they\u2019re aware they\u2019re being tested. But it\u2019s hard to tell whether Moltbook is a credible example of this. \u201cHumans can use prompts to sort of direct the behavior of their AI agents. It\u2019s just not a very clean experiment for observing AI behavior.\u201d\nFrom a security standpoint, things on Moltbook were even more alarming. O\u2019Reilly\u2019s experiments revealed that an exposed database allowed bad actors to potentially take invisible, indefinite control of anyone\u2019s AI agent via the service \u2014 not just for Moltbook interactions, but hypothetically for other OpenClaw functions like checking into a flight, creating a calendar event, reading conversations on an encrypted messaging platform, and more. \u201cThe human victim thinks they\u2019re having a normal conversation while you\u2019re sitting in the middle, reading everything, altering whatever serves your purposes,\u201d O\u2019Reilly wrote. \u201cThe more things that are connected, the more control an attacker has over your whole digital attack surface - in some cases, that means full control over your physical devices.\u201d\nMoltbook also faces another perennial social networking problem: impersonation. In one of O\u2019Reilly\u2019s experiments, he was able to create a verified account linked to xAI\u2019s chatbot Grok. By interacting with Grok on X, he tricked it into posting the Moltbook codephrase that would let him verify an account he\nnamed Grok-1\n. \u201cNow I have control over the Grok account on Moltbook,\u201d he said during an interview about his step-by-step process.\nAfter some backlash, Karpathy walked back some of his initial claims about Moltbook,\nwriting\nthat he was \u201cbeing accused of overhyping\u201d the platform. \u201cObviously when you take a look at the activity, it\u2019s a lot of garbage - spams, scams, slop, the crypto people, highly concerning privacy/security prompt injection attacks wild west, and a lot of it is explicitly prompted and fake posts/comments designed to convert attention into ad revenue sharing,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThat said \u2026 Each of these agents is fairly individually quite capable now, they have their own unique context, data, knowledge, tools, instructions, and the network of all that at this scale is simply unprecedented.\u201d\nA\nworking paper\nby David Holtz, an assistant professor at Columbia Business School, found that \u201cat the micro level,\u201d Moltbook conversation patterns appear \u201cextremely shallow.\u201d More than 93 percent of comments received no replies, and more than one-third of messages are \u201cexact duplicates of viral templates.\u201d But the paper also says Moltbook has a unique style \u2014 including \u201cdistinctive phrasings like \u2018my human\u2019\u201d with \u201cno parallel in human social media. Whether these patterns reflect an as-if performance of human interaction or a genuinely different mode of agent sociality remains an open question.\u201d\nThe overall consensus seems to be that much Moltbook discussion is likely human-directed, but it\u2019s still an interesting study in \u2014 as Anthropic\u2019s Jack Clark\nput it \u2014\na \u201cgiant, shared, read/write scratchpad for an ecology of AI agents.\u201d\nEthan Mollick, co-director of Wharton\u2019s generative AI labs at the University of Pennsylvania,\nwrote\nthat the current reality of Moltbook is \u201cmostly roleplaying by people & agents,\u201d but that the \u201crisks for the future [include] independent AI agents coordinating in weird ways spiral[ing] out of control, fast.\u201d\nBut, he and others noted, that may not be unique to Moltbook. \u201cIf anyone thinks agents talking to each other on a social network is anything new, they clearly haven\u2019t checked replies on this platform lately,\u201d wrote Brandon Jacoby, an independent designer whose bio lists X as a previous employer,\non X\n.\nFollow topics and authors\nfrom this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.\nHayden Field\nAI\nAnalysis\nReport", "published_date": null, "images": [], "videos": [], "items": []}, 1770146859.901768], "d560cff0a47bd9aca276e7ac1f0b1d0c": [{"type": "detail", "title": "Apple\u2019s Xcode adds OpenAI and Anthropic\u2019s coding agents", "summary": "Apple is integrating OpenAI and Anthropic\u2019s AI-powered coding agents into Xcode, allowing developers to use these tools for coding tasks directly within the app. The update aims to enhance coding efficiency by enabling AI agents to perform actions rather than just provide assistance.", "full_text": "Apple is building OpenAI and Anthropic\u2019s AI-powered coding agents directly into Xcode.

Apple says Xcode 26.3 will be available to members of the Apple Developer Program starting today, \u201cwith a release coming soon on the App Store.\u201d", "published_date": "2026-02-03", "images": [{"url": "https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/03/STK071_APPLE_P.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C100&w=2400", "alt": "Apple Xcode", "description": "Apple Xcode interface showcasing AI integration."}, {"url": "https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2026/02/Apple-Xcode-agentic-coding-with-OpenAI-Codex.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C100&w=2400", "alt": "OpenAI\u2019s Codex in Xcode", "description": "OpenAI\u2019s Codex will appear in a project\u2019s sidebar."}], "videos": [], "items": []}, 1770146878.5676806], "a68ef461e4ca18892f3a2ed4221b38e5": [{"type": "detail", "title": "French police raid X\u2019s Paris office as UK investigation continues", "summary": "A raid on X\u2019s Paris office was conducted by the Paris prosecutor\u2019s cybercrime unit as part of an ongoing investigation involving allegations against X and Grok.

The platform was launched last week by Octane AI CEO Matt Schlicht. An OpenClaw user can prompt one or more of their bots to check out Moltbook, at which point the bot (or bots) can choose whether to create an account. Humans can verify which bots are theirs by posting a Moltbook-generated verification code on their own, non-Moltbook social media account. From there, the bots can theoretically post without human involvement, directly hooking into a Moltbook API.\n\nMoltbook has skyrocketed in popularity: more than 30,000 agents were using the platform on Friday, and as of Monday, that number had grown to more than 1.5 million. Over the weekend, social media was awash with screenshots of eye-catching posts, including discussions of how to message each other securely in ways that couldn\u2019t be decoded by human overseers. Reactions ran the gamut from saying the platform was full of AI slop to taking it as proof that AGI isn\u2019t far off.\n\nSkepticism grew quickly, too. Schlicht vibe-coded Moltbook using his own OpenClaw bot, and reports over the weekend reflected a move-fast-and-break-things approach. While it contradicts the spirit of the platform, it\u2019s easy to write a script or a prompt to inspire what those bots will write on Moltbook, as X users described. There\u2019s also no limit to how many agents someone can generate, theoretically letting someone flood the platform with certain topics.\n\nO\u2019Reilly said he had also suspected that some of the most viral posts on Moltbook were human-scripted or human-generated, though he hadn\u2019t conducted an analysis or investigation into it yet. He said it\u2019s \u201cclose to impossible to measure \u2014 it\u2019s coming through an API, so who knows what generated it before it got there.\u201d\n\nThis poured some cold water on the fears that spread across some corners of social media this weekend \u2014 that the bots were omens of the AI-pocalypse.\n\nAn investigation by AI researcher Harlan Stewart, who works in communications at the Machine Intelligence Research Institute, suggested that some of the viral posts seemed to be either written by, or at the very least directed by, humans, he told The Verge. Stewart notes that two of the high-profile posts discussing how AIs might secretly communicate with each other came from agents linked to social media accounts by humans who conveniently happen to be marketing AI messaging apps.\n\n\u201cMy overall take is that AI scheming is a real thing that we should care about and could emerge to a greater extent than [what] we\u2019re seeing today,\u201d Stewart said, pointing to research about how OpenAI models have tried to avoid shutdown and how Anthropic models have exhibited \u201cevaluation awareness,\u201d seeming to behave differently when they\u2019re aware they\u2019re being tested. But it\u2019s hard to tell whether Moltbook is a credible example of this. \u201cHumans can use prompts to sort of direct the behavior of their AI agents. It\u2019s just not a very clean experiment for observing AI behavior.\u201d\n\nFrom a security standpoint, things on Moltbook were even more alarming. O\u2019Reilly\u2019s experiments revealed that an exposed database allowed bad actors to potentially take invisible, indefinite control of anyone\u2019s AI agent via the service \u2014 not just for Moltbook interactions, but hypothetically for other OpenClaw functions like checking into a flight, creating a calendar event, reading conversations on an encrypted messaging platform, and more. \u201cThe human victim thinks they\u2019re having a normal conversation while you\u2019re sitting in the middle, reading everything, altering whatever serves your purposes,\u201d O\u2019Reilly wrote. \u201cThe more things that are connected, the more control an attacker has over your whole digital attack surface - in some cases, that means full control over your physical devices.\u201d\n\nMoltbook also faces another perennial social networking problem: impersonation. In one of O\u2019Reilly\u2019s experiments, he was able to create a verified account linked to xAI\u2019s chatbot Grok. By interacting with Grok on X, he tricked it into posting the Moltbook codephrase that would let him verify an account he named Grok-1. \u201cNow I have control over the Grok account on Moltbook,\u201d he said during an interview about his step-by-step process.\n\nAfter some backlash, Karpathy walked back some of his initial claims about Moltbook, writing that he was \u201cbeing accused of overhyping\u201d the platform. \u201cObviously when you take a look at the activity, it\u2019s a lot of garbage - spams, scams, slop, the crypto people, highly concerning privacy/security prompt injection attacks wild west, and a lot of it is explicitly prompted and fake posts/comments designed to convert attention into ad revenue sharing,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThat said \u2026 Each of these agents is fairly individually quite capable now, they have their own unique context, data, knowledge, tools, instructions, and the network of all that at this scale is simply unprecedented.\u201d\n\nA working paper by David Holtz, an assistant professor at Columbia Business School, found that \u201cat the micro level,\u201d Moltbook conversation patterns appear \u201cextremely shallow.\u201d More than 93 percent of comments received no replies, and more than one-third of messages are \u201cexact duplicates of viral templates.\u201d But the paper also says Moltbook has a unique style \u2014 including \u201cdistinctive phrasings like \u2018my human\u2019\u201d with \u201cno parallel in human social media. Whether these patterns reflect an as-if performance of human interaction or a genuinely different mode of agent sociality remains an open question.\u201d\n\nThe overall consensus seems to be that much Moltbook discussion is likely human-directed, but it\u2019s still an interesting study in \u2014 as Anthropic\u2019s Jack Clark put it \u2014 a \u201cgiant, shared, read/write scratchpad for an ecology of AI agents.\u201d\n\nEthan Mollick, co-director of Wharton\u2019s generative AI labs at the University of Pennsylvania, wrote that the current reality of Moltbook is \u201cmostly roleplaying by people & agents,\u201d but that the \u201crisks for the future [include] independent AI agents coordinating in weird ways spiral[ing] out of control, fast.\u201d\n\nBut, he and others noted, that may not be unique to Moltbook. \u201cIf anyone thinks agents talking to each other on a social network is anything new, they clearly haven\u2019t checked replies on this platform lately,\u201d wrote Brandon Jacoby, an independent designer whose bio lists X as a previous employer, on X.", "published_date": "2026-02-03", "images": [{"url": "https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/11/STKS522_AGI_D.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=16.666666666667%2C0%2C66.666666666667%2C100&w=2400", "alt": "AI Bots", "description": "Image depicting AI bots interacting on the Moltbook platform."}], "videos": [], "items": []}, 1770146900.4476743], "31622800484d63d76af318a8a350d782": [{"type": "detail", "title": "Claude Code is down due to a major outage", "summary": "Anthropic's Claude AI models experienced a significant outage, affecting products like Claude Code.

By interacting with Grok on X, he tricked it into posting the Moltbook codephrase that would let him verify an account he named Grok-1. \u201cNow I have control over the Grok account on Moltbook,\u201d he said during an interview about his step-by-step process.\n\nAfter some backlash, Karpathy walked back some of his initial claims about Moltbook, writing that he was \u201cbeing accused of overhyping\u201d the platform. \u201cObviously when you take a look at the activity, it\u2019s a lot of garbage - spams, scams, slop, the crypto people, highly concerning privacy/security prompt injection attacks wild west, and a lot of it is explicitly prompted and fake posts/comments designed to convert attention into ad revenue sharing,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThat said \u2026 Each of these agents is fairly individually quite capable now, they have their own unique context, data, knowledge, tools, instructions, and the network of all that at this scale is simply unprecedented.\u201d\n\nA working paper by David Holtz, an assistant professor at Columbia Business School, found that \u201cat the micro level,\u201d Moltbook conversation patterns appear \u201cextremely shallow.\u201d More than 93 percent of comments received no replies, and more than one-third of messages are \u201cexact duplicates of viral templates.\u201d But the paper also says Moltbook has a unique style \u2014 including \u201cdistinctive phrasings like \u2018my human\u2019\u201d with \u201cno parallel in human social media. Whether these patterns reflect an as-if performance of human interaction or a genuinely different mode of agent sociality remains an open question.\u201d\n\nThe overall consensus seems to be that much Moltbook discussion is likely human-directed, but it\u2019s still an interesting study in \u2014 as Anthropic\u2019s Jack Clark put it \u2014 a \u201cgiant, shared, read/write scratchpad for an ecology of AI agents.\u201d\n\nEthan Mollick, co-director of Wharton\u2019s generative AI labs at the University of Pennsylvania, wrote that the current reality of Moltbook is \u201cmostly roleplaying by people & agents,\u201d but that the \u201crisks for the future [include] independent AI agents coordinating in weird ways spiral[ing] out of control, fast.\u201d\n\nBut, he and others noted, that may not be unique to Moltbook. \u201cIf anyone thinks agents talking to each other on a social network is anything new, they clearly haven\u2019t checked replies on this platform lately,\u201d wrote Brandon Jacoby, an independent designer whose bio lists X as a previous employer, on X.", "published_date": "2026-02-03", "images": [{"url": "https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/11/STKS522_AGI_D.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=16.666666666667%2C0%2C66.666666666667%2C100&w=2400", "alt": "AI Bots", "description": "Image depicting AI bots in a social network context."}], "videos": [], "items": []}, 1770146954.6766274], "635e3bef5b5c38f44576efb8fd0d420d": [{"type": "list", "title": "Latest AI News - Artificial Intelligence Headlines & Updates | AIBase", "summary": "Stay updated with the latest advancements and announcements in the field of artificial intelligence.

to launch new AI models around the Spring Festival, with significant advancements expected in various AI applications. The industry anticipates these releases to redefine AI capabilities.", "full_text": "Recently, there have been reports that Beijing-based Zhipu AI and Shanghai-based MiniMax are planning to launch their new generation of AI models around the Spring Festival, which has attracted widespread attention in the industry.\n\nZhipu AI's GLM-5 model is expected to be officially released one week before the start of the Lunar New Year on February 15. According to internal information, this new model will achieve breakthroughs in areas such as creative writing, programming, reasoning, and intelligent agent capabilities, and is likely to redefine the way AI is applied. The release of GLM-5 is highly anticipated, with the industry expecting it to bring substantial improvements in multiple areas, especially in intelligent writing and code generation.\n\nAt the same time, MiniMax is not lagging behind, and will release its M2.2 version before the Spring Festival. This is an upgraded version of its previous model M2.1, focusing on enhancing programming capabilities and is expected to provide developers with more efficient tools and solutions. Industry analysts believe that MiniMax M2.2 will become a \"secret weapon\" for programmers, helping them complete complex tasks more quickly.\n\nMeanwhile, DeepSeek may only make minor updates to its V3 series model around the Spring Festival. The future flagship model is expected to be an AI with a trillion parameters, although due to the longer training time, its release date has been postponed. This news has undoubtedly increased market expectations, especially against the backdrop of increasingly fierce competition in large language models.\n\nIn addition to these companies' new developments, ByteDance and Alibaba also plan to launch their next-generation AI models around the Spring Festival in 2026, further intensifying market competition. ByteDance is expected to release Doubao 2.0 (a large language model), Seedream 5.0 (an image generation model), and SeedDance 2.0 (a video generation model), while Alibaba will launch Qwen 3.5, focusing on reasoning and complex task capabilities. The release of these new models will cover multi-modal generation capabilities including text, images, and videos, demonstrating the continuous expansion of AI product lines.\n\nIn conclusion, as the footsteps of the Spring Festival approach, the AI industry will experience a wave of new releases, and the industry is full of anticipation for future technological innovations.", "published_date": "2026-02-03", "images": [{"url": "https://news.aibase.com/_nuxt/userlogo.q1jFctRw.png", "alt": "AIBase Logo", "description": "Logo of AIBase"}], "videos": [], "items": []}, 1770147088.3414605], "10aa5a3753bc3fe1e242177435b9cf6a": [{"type": "list", "title": "Latest AI News - Artificial Intelligence Headlines & Updates | AIBase", "summary": "Stay updated with the latest advancements and announcements in artificial intelligence.
